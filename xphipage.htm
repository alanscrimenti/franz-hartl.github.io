</p>
<blockquote>Theory of mind, the capacity to understand and ascribe mental states, has traditionally been conceptualized as analogous to a scientiﬁc theory. However, recent work in philosophy and psychology has documented a ''side-effect effect" suggesting that moral evaluations inﬂuence mental state ascriptions, and in particular whether a behavior is described as having been performed 'intentionally.' This evidence challenges the idea that theory of mind is analogous to scientiﬁc psychology in serving the function of predicting and explaining, rather than evaluating, behavior. In three experiments, we demonstrate that moral evaluations do inform ascriptions of intentional action, but that this relationship arises because behavior that conforms to norms (moral or otherwise) is less informative about underlying mental states than is behavior that violates norms. This analysis preserves the traditional understanding of theory of mind as a tool for predicting and explaining behavior, but also suggests the importance of normative considerations in social cognition.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>Moral philosophers of varying theoretical commitments maintain that ordinary, pre-philosophical folk are objectivists about morality, that they view moral issues as having a single correct answer as opposed to several correct answers that are all true relative to a given perspective or culture.  This empirical claim has been an article of faith for many philosophers, a datum that must be captured or explained by any theory of morality.  But is the claim correct?  After reviewing some of the extant philosophical and psychological literature on this topic, we present evidence from a new study suggesting that even while folk often speak in objectivist terms, they might, at some deeper level, embrace relativism about morality.</blockquote>

Unpublished Manuscript.
</p>
<blockquote>Empirical work on the use of causal language by ordinary people indicates that their causal attributions tend to be sensitive not only to purely descriptive considerations, but also to broadly moral considerations. For example, ordinary causal attributions appear to be highly sensitive to whether a behavior is permissible or impermissible. Recently, however, a consensus view has emerged that situates the role of permissibility information within a broader framework: According to the consensus, ordinary causal attributions are sensitive to whether or not a behavior is generally out of the norm, where being out of the norm might indicate deviation from a prescriptive norm (a broadly moral consideration) or deviation from a statistical norm (a purely descriptive consideration). In contrast, we conjecture that ordinary causal attributions are more directly connected to broadly moral judgments about normative responsibility (the responsibility view). We present the results of a series of new experimental studies that are consistent with the responsibility view, while indicating that the consensus position is seriously mistaken.</blockquote>

Unpublished Manuscript
</p>
<blockquote>Suppose we consider the concept <i>happiness</i>, or the concept <i>love</i>. How are these concepts to be understood? One obvious hypothesis would be that they are best understood as being more or less like other mental state the concepts, e.g., <i>belief</i>. Perhaps these concepts, too, simply serve to pick out a particular mental state and thereby enable people to explain, predict and understand others' behavior.
We will argue that this hypothesis is mistaken. Instead, we suggest that some of the different concepts people use to understand the mind are fundamentally different from others. While there are concepts that do serve simply to pick out a particular mental state, others allow a role for evaluative judgments. So, for example, our claim will be that when people are wondering whether a given agent is 'truly happy' or 'truly in love,' they are not merely trying to figure out whether this agent has a particular sort of mental state. They are also concerned in a central way with evaluating the agent's situation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Recently, a number of philosophers have advanced a surprising conclusion – people's 
  judgments about whether an agent brought about an outcome intentionally are 
  pervasively influenced by normative considerations. In this paper, we examine an 
  influential case from this literature using structural path modeling and show this 
  conclusion is incorrect – people's attributions of intentional action to an agent are driven 
  not by normative assessments, but rather by attributions of underlying values and
  characterological dispositions to the agent. We also discuss the tracking problem, the 
  problem of figuring out which features of hypothetical cases our intuitions are responsive 
  to. We discuss how the statistical methods used in this study have some advantages over

  philosophers. </blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>At least since the middle of the twentieth century, philosophers have tended to identify weakness of will with akrasia—i.e. acting, or having a disposition to act, contrary to one's judgments about what is best for one to do.  However, there has been some recent debate about whether this captures the ordinary notion of weakness of will. Richard Holton (1999, 2009) claims that it doesn't, while Alfred Mele (forthcoming) argues that, to a certain extent, it does.  As Mele recognizes, the question about an ordinary concept here is one apt for empirical investigation.  Our plan is to evaluate Mele's studies and report some experiments of our own in order to investigate what in the world the ordinary concept of weakness of will is. We conclude that neither Mele nor Holton (previously) was quite right and offer a tentative proposal of our own:  the ordinary notion is more like a prototype or cluster concept. </blockquote>

Resolving a Controversy Over Intentionality and Morality</a> Under Submission.
</p>
<blockquote>Can an event's blameworthiness distort whether people see the event as intentional? In controversial recent studies, people judged a behavior's negative side effect as intentional even 
though the agent allegedly had no desire for the side effect to occur.  Such a judgment contradicts the standard assumption that desire is a necessary condition of intentionality, and it raises concerns about lay assessments of intentionality in legal settings. Six studies examined whether blameworthy events distort intentionality judgments.  Studies 1-4 show that, counter to recent claims, intentionality judgments are systematically guided by variations in the agent's desire, for moral and nonmoral actions alike. Studies 5 and 6 show that a behavior's negative side effects are rarely seen as intentional once people are allowed to choose from multiple options of describing the behavior.  In particular, people systematically distinguish between "knowingly" and "intentionally" bringing about a side effect, even for immoral actions. These studies suggest that intentionality judgments are unaffected by a behavior's blameworthiness.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>Extant models of moral judgment assume that an action's intentionality precedes assignments of blame.  Knobe (2003b) challenged this fundamental order and proposed instead that the blameworthiness of an action directs (and thus unduly biases) people's intentionality judgments.  His and other researchers' studies suggested that blameworthy actions are considered intentional 
even when the agent lacks skill (e.g., killing somebody with a lucky shot) whereas equivalent neutral actions are not (e.g., luckily hitting the bull's-eye).  The present five studies offer an alternative account of these provocative findings.  We suggest that the morally significant action examined in previous studies (killing) is seen as accomplished by a basic action (pressing the trigger) for which an unskilled agent still has sufficient skill.  Studies 1 through 3 show that when this basic action is performed unskillfully or is absent, people are far less likely to view the killing as intentional, demonstrating that intentionality judgments, even about immoral actions, are guided by skill information.  Studies 4 and 5 further show that a neutral action such as hitting the bull's-eye is more difficult than killing and that difficult actions are less often judged intentional.  When difficulty is held constant, people's intentionality judgments are fully responsive to skill information regardless of moral valence.  The present studies thus speak against the hypothesis of a moral evaluation bias in intentionality judgments and instead document people's sensitivity to subtle features of human action.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>Armchair philosophers have questioned the significance of recent work in experimental philosophy by pointing out that experiments have been conducted on laypeople and undergraduate students. To challenge a practice that relies on expert intuitions, so the armchair objection goes, one needs to demonstrate that expert intuitions rather than those of ordinary people are sensitive to contingent facts such as cultural, linguistic, socio-economic, or educational background. In this paper we do exactly that. Based on an empirical study on a population of 817 trained philosophers, we demonstrate that expert intuitions vary dramatically according to at least one contingent factor, namely the linguistic background of the expert:  philosophers make significantly different intuitive judgments if their native language is English rather than Dutch, German, or Swedish. Our findings cast doubt on the common armchair assumption that philosophical theories based on armchair intuitions are valid beyond the linguistic background against which they were developed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It would be a mistake to deny commonsense intuitions a role in developing a theory of consciousness. However, philosophers have traditionally failed to probe commonsense in a way that allows these commonsense intuitions to make a robust contribution to a theory of consciousness. In this paper, I report the results of two experiments on purportedly phenomenal states and I argue that many disputes over the philosophical notion of 'phenomenal consciousness' are misguided—they fail to capture the interesting connection between commonsense ascriptions of pain and emotion. With this data in hand, I argue that our capacity to distinguish between 'mere things' and 'subjects of moral concern' rests, to a significant extent, on the sorts of mental states that we take a system to have.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Traditionally, the philosophical study of Folk Psychology has focused on how ordinary people (those without academic training in fields like Psychology, Cognitive Science, Philosophy of Mind, etc.) go about attributing mental states like beliefs and desires.  Philosophers call such states intentional states.  Recently, a body of work has emerged in the growing field of Experimental Philosophy that focuses on folk attributions of certain states not previously discussed in the Folk Psychological literature; namely the discussion is concerned with figuring out how (and whether) ordinary people go about attributing mental states of qualitative experience, or what philosophers might call phenomenal consciousness.  The discussion has centered, largely, on two questions: Do the folk distinguish, in some sense, between states of phenomenal consciousness and nonphenomenal states (like intentional states)?  And if they do distinguish between the two kinds of states, do the folk discriminate between different kinds of entities in their attributions of phenomenal states?  This paper hopes to contribute to that discussion by discerning two primary hypotheses presently competing in the existing experimental philosophy literature, by presenting some experimental data that weigh on those hypotheses, and by offering a cognitive model of the processes underlying attributions of mental states.</blockquote>

In this paper, we consider the merits of appealing to the intuition that there is nothing that it's like to be a collectivity. We demonstrate that collective mentality is not an affront to commonsense, and we report evidence that demonstrates that the intuition that there is nothing that it's like to be a collectivity is, to some extent, culturally specific rather than universally held.

<blockquote>It is not uncommon to find assumptions being made about folk psychology in the discussions of phenomenal consciousness in philosophy of mind. In this article I consider one example, focusing on what Dan Dennett says about the "folk theory of consciousness." I show that he holds that the folk believe that qualities like colors that we are acquainted with in ordinary perception are phenomenal qualities. Nonetheless, the shape of the folk theory is an empirical matter and in the absence of empirical investigation there is ample room for doubt... </blockquote>

<blockquote>In studying folk psychology, cognitive and developmental psychologists have mainly focused on how people conceive of non-experiential states such as beliefs and desires. As a result, we know very little about how non-philosophers (or the folk) understand the mental states that philosophers typically classify as being phenomenally conscious. In particular, it is not known whether the folk even tend to classify mental states in terms of their being or not being phenomenally conscious in the first place. Things have changed dramatically in the last few years, however, with a flurry of ground-breaking research by psychologists and experimental philosophers... </blockquote>

<blockquote>Throughout the twentieth century, an enormous amount of intellectual fuel was spent debating the merits of a class of skeptical arguments which purport to show that knowledge of the external world is not possible. These arguments, whose origins can be traced back to Descartes, played an important role in the work of some of the leading philosophers of the twentieth century, including Russell, Moore and Wittgenstein, and they continue to engage the interest of contemporary philosophers (for example Cohen 1999; DeRose 1995; Hill 1996; Klein 1981; Lewis 1996; McGinn 1993; Nozick 1981; Schiffer 1996; Unger 1975; Williams 1991).

Beyond an appeal to intuition, little or no defence is offered, and in many cases it is hard to see what else could be said in support of these premises...</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been standard philosophical practice in analytic philosophy to employ intuitions generated in response to thought-experiments as evidence in the evaluation of philosophical claims.  In part as a response to this practice, an exciting new movement—experimental philosophy—has recently emerged.  This movement is unified behind both a common methodology and a common aim: the application of methods of experimental psychology to the study of the nature of intuitions.  In this paper, we will introduce two different views concerning the relationship that holds between experimental philosophy and the future of standard philosophical practice (what we call, the proper foundation view  and the restrictionist view), discuss some of the more interesting and important results obtained by proponents of both views, and examine the pressure these results put on analytic philosophers to reform standard philosophical practice.  We will also defend experimental philosophy from some recent objections, suggest future directions for work in experimental philosophy, and suggest what future lines of epistemological response might be available to those wishing to defend analytic epistemology from the challenges posed by experimental philosophy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Using empirical evidence to attack intuitions can be epistemically dangerous, because various of the complaints that one might raise against them (e.g., that they are fallible; that we possess no non-circular defense of their reliability) can be raised just as easily against perception itself. But the opponents of intuition wish to challenge intuitions without at the same time challenging the rest of our epistemic apparatus. How might this be done? Let us use the term "hopefulness" to refer to the extent to which we possess a good capacity for the detection and correction of the errors of any fallible source of evidence. I argue that we should not trust putative sources of evidence that are substantially lacking in hopefulness (even if they are basically reliable), and that we are indeed already operating under such a norm in our ordinary and scientific practices. I argue further that the philosophical practice of the appeal to intuitions is, in these terms, badly hopeless...</blockquote>

<blockquote>George Bealer argues that intuitions are not only reliable indicators of truth, they are necessary to the philosophical endeavor. Specifically, he thinks that intuitions are essential sources of evidence for epistemic justification. I argue that Bealer's defense of intuitions either (1) is insufficient to show that actual human beings are in a position to use intuitions for epistemic justification, or (2) begs the question. The growing empirical data about our intuitions support the view that humans are not creatures appropriately positioned to use intuitions for epistemic justification in the way Bealer suggests. Without the appropriate empirical evidence that humans are beings so positioned, his view begs the question against those who think that intuitions are not reliable guides to truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In "Epistemology Naturalized", Quine famously suggests that epistemology, properly understood, "simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science" (1969, 82). Since the appearance of Quine's seminal article, virtually every epistemologist, including the later Quine (1986, 664), has repudiated the idea that a normative discipline like epistemology could be reduced to a purely descriptive discipline like psychology. Working epistemologists no longer take Quine's vision in "Epistemology Naturalized" seriously. In this paper, I will explain why I think this is a mistake. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Stephen Stich published a number of works that criticized analytic epistemology and defended a pragmatic view of cognitive assessment (1985, 1988, 1990, 1993). In the past five years, Stich, Jonathan Weinberg and Shaun Nichols (henceforth, WNS) have put forward a number of empirically-based arguments criticizing epistemology in the analytic tradition (Weinberg, Nichols and Stich 2001; Nichols, Stich and Weinberg 2003). My thesis is that the most powerful features of Stich's epistemological views vindicate Quine's now moribund naturalism. I expect this thesis to be met with incredulity – not least from Stich, who has explicitly argued that the reductionist view standardly attributed to Quine is a non-starter (1993, 3-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been claimed that the attempt to analyze know-how in terms of propositional knowledge over-intellectualizes the mind. Exploiting the methods of so-called "experimental philosophy", we show that the charge of over-intellectualization is baseless. Contra neo-Ryleans, who analyze know-how in terms of ability, the concretecase judgments of ordinary folk are most consistent with the view that there exists a set of correct necessary and sufficient conditions for know-how that does not invoke ability, but rather a certain sort of propositional knowledge. To the extent that one's considered judgments agree with those of the folk (or to the extent that one is unwilling to contravene widespread judgments), this constitutes a strong prima facie case against neo-Ryleanism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Recent theories of epistemic contextualism have challenged traditional invariantist positions in epistemology by claiming that the truth conditions of knowledge attributions fluctuate between conversational contexts. Contextualists often garner support for this view by appealing to folk intuitions regarding the knowledge practices of normal agents in everyday speech. Proposed is a set of experiments designed to test for the descriptive conditions upon which these types of contextualist defenses rely. In the cases tested, experiments indicate that the contextualist pattern of knowledge attribution does not obtain among ordinary speakers. These results, while preliminary, inspire prima facie skepticism for the contextualist hypothesis regarding knowledge claims, as well as challenge certain predictions made by recent theories of subject-sensitive invariantism. It is further argued that these findings raise methodological questions concerning the practice of parlaying an assumption of intuitions, with respect to ordinary language practices, into philosophical conclusions regarding knowledge.</blockquote>

Jason Stanley (2005) argues that, in addition to "traditional factors," our ordinary practice of knowledge ascription is sensitive to the practical facts of a subject's situation. In this paper, we investigate this question empirically. Our results indicate that Stanley's predictions about ordinary knowledge ascriptions are false. If we are right, then arguments for anti-intellectualism which rely on ordinary knowledge ascriptions fail.

<blockquote>Some philosophers have recently defended anti-intellectualism with respect to knowledge, justification, or evidence. In this paper, we assess anti-intellectualism about evidence. Proponents of anti-intellectualism generally regard their view as not at all obvious, but nonetheless strongly supported by appeal to our intuitive judgments about whether particular epistemic properties are instantiated in hypothetical cases. Anti-intellectualism is thus taken by its proponents to be a surprising truth. We show that intuitive judgments about whether particular epistemic properties are instantiated in hypothetical cases do not even come close to displaying the pattern that the anti-intellectualist about evidence thinks they display: In fact, those data tell strongly against such anti-intellectualism. Nonetheless, we show, peoples' intuitive judgments about the general issue of whether or not non-epistemic factors make an epistemic difference are often in line with anti-intellectualism about evidence...</blockquote>

We found that intuitions in response to this case vary according to whether, and which, other thought experiments are considered first.  Our results show that compared to subjects who receive the Truetemp Case first, subjects first presented with a clear case of knowledge are less willing to attribute knowledge in the Truetemp Case, and subjects first presented with a clear case of non-knowledge are more willing to attribute knowledge in the Truetemp Case.  We contend that this instability undermines the supposed evidential status of these intuitions, such that philosophers who deal in intuitions can no longer rest comfortably in their armchairs.</blockquote>

<blockquote> This chapter examines several ways in which philosophical attention to intuition can contribute to empirical scientific psychology. The authors then discuss one prevalent misuse of intuition. An unspoken assumption of much argumentation in the philosophy of mind has been that to articulate our folk psychological intuitions, our ordinary concepts of belief, truth, meaning, and so forth, is itself sufficient to give a theoretical account of what belief, truth, meaning, and so forth, actually are. It is believed that this assumption rests on an inadequate understanding of the nature of intuition and its appropriate applications, and that it results in errors. Three notable examples of this sort of misuse of intuition in philosophy are briefly discussed. Finally, the authors provide developmental evidence for the mutability and fallibility of everyday intuitions about the mind, evidence that undermines arguments, that depend on taking such intuitions as a final authority for substantive claims about what the mind is like.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the earliest days of analytic philosophy, it has been a common practice to appeal to intuitions about particular cases. Typically, the philosopher presents a hypothetical situation and then makes a claim of the form: 'In this case, we would surely say....' This claim about people's intuitions then forms a part of an argument for some more general theory about the nature of our concepts or our use of language. One puzzling aspect of this practice is that it so rarely... </blockquote>

Given both the breadth of the research being carried out by experimental philosophers and the controversial nature of some of their central methodological assumptions, it is of no surprise that their work has recently come under attack. In this paper we respond to some criticisms of experimental philosophy that have recently been put forward by Antti Kauppinen. Unlike the critics of experimental philosophy, we do not think the fledgling movement either will or should fall before it has even had a chance to rise up to explain what it is, what it seeks to do (and not to do), and exactly how it plans to do it. Filling in some of the salient details is the main goal of the present paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>First, we briefly familiarize the reader with the nascent field of "experimental philosophy," in which philosophers use empirical methods, rather than armchair speculation, to ascertain laypersons' intuitions about philosophical issues. Second, we discuss how the surveys used by experimental philosophers can serve as valuable pedagogical tools for teaching philosophy-independently of whether one believes surveying laypersons is an illuminating approach to doing philosophy. Giving students surveys that contain questions and thought experiments from philosophical debates gets them to actively engage with the material and paves the way for more fruitful and impassioned classroom discussion. We offer some suggestions for how to use surveys in the classroom and provide an appendix that contains some examples of scenarios teachers could use in their courses. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Despite well-established results in survey methodology, many experimental philosophers have not asked whether and in what way conclusions about folk intuitions follow from people's responses to their surveys. Rather, they appear to have proceeded on the assumption that intuitions can be simply read off from survey responses. Survey research, however, is fraught with difficulties. I review some of the relevant literature—particularly focusing on the conversational pragmatic aspects of survey research—and consider its application to common experimental philosophy surveys. I argue for two claims. First, that experimental philosophers' survey methodology leaves the facts about folk intuitions massively underdetermined; and second, that what has been regarded as evidence for the instability of philosophical intuitions is, at least in some cases, better accounted for in terms of subjects' reactions to subtle pragmatic cues contained in the surveys.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The practice of conceptual analysis has undergone a revival in recent years. Although the extent of its role in philosophy is controversial, many now accept that conceptual analysis has at least some role to play. Granting this, I consider the relevance of empirical investigation to conceptual analysis. I do so by contrasting an extreme position (anti-empirical conceptual analysis) with a more moderate position (non-empirical conceptual analysis). I argue that anti-empirical conceptual analysis is not a viable position because it has no means for resolving conceptual disputes that arise between seemingly competent speakers of the language. This is illustrated by considering one such dispute that has been pressed by a prominent advocate of anti-empirical conceptual analysis...</blockquote>

Our answer is that one important aspect of the philosophical temperament is that philosophers are especially reflective: They are less likely than their peers to embrace what seems obvious without questioning it.

We discuss people's understanding and use of these concepts, address recent findings that challenge the autonomous role of these concepts in moral judgment, and conclude that choice is the fundamental concept of the three, defining the core of folk psychology in moral judgment. </blockquote>

The experimental philosopher Knobe conducted a questionnaire study that revealed that people blame others for foreseen negative externalities but do not praise them for foreseen positive ones. We find that the major determinant of the Knobe effect is the relative distribution of economic power among the agents. We confirm the Knobe effect only in situations where the producer of the externality holds the higher economic status and the positive externalities are small. Switching economic power makes the Knobe effect vanish. The Knobe effect is even reversed in settings with large positive externalities. Our results are in line with theoretical predictions by Levine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is widely agreed that folk psychology plays an important role in people's moral judgments. For a simple example, take the process by which we determine whether or not an agent is morally blameworthy. Although the judgment here is ultimately a moral one, it seems that one needs to use a fair amount of folk psychology along the way. Thus, one might determine that an agent broke the vase intentionally and therefore conclude that she is blameworthy for breaking it. </blockquote>

Unlike these other types of explanations, it explains an agent's behavior by describing the agent's own _reasons_ for performing that behavior. Explanations that work in…</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the surface, it seems intuitively plausible that if an agent luckily manages to perform a desired action (e.g., rolling a six with a fair die or winning the lottery), the performance of which is not the result of any relevant skill on her part, we should not say that she performed the action intentionally. This intuition suggests that our concept of intentional action is sensitive to considerations of skill, luck, and causal control. Indeed, some philosophers have claimed that in order for an action to be performed intentionally it must be performed with a relevant amount of skill or control—i.e., an intentional action cannot simply be the result of luck. On this view, skill and control are necessary conditions of our everyday concept of intentional action. In this essay, I discuss empirical evidence that challenges this claim. After briefly setting the stage, I examine Al Mele and Paul Moser's thorough analysis of intentional action—paying particular attention to some of the interesting scenarios they offer in support of their position. Next, I discuss the results of some simple psychological experiments that show that people's judgments concerning whether actions are intentional can often be affected by the moral features of these actions—features that may trump considerations of skill, luck, and control. Finally, I conclude that if this is correct, philosophers who claim that skill and control are necessary conditions of the folk concept of intentional action appear to be mistaken. </blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the analysis of intentional action that Michael Bratman has dubbed the 'Simple View'(SV) (1984: 377), intending to x is necessary for intentionally x-ing (e.g., Adams 1986; McCann 1986; 1991).  Despite the plausibility of this view, there is gathering empirical evidence that it does not settle with our ordinary usage of the concept of intentional action (Knobe 2003a; 2003b; 2004).  More specifically, it appears that in cases involving moral considerations, people are much more likely to judge that the action (or side effect) in question was performed or brought about intentionally than they are to judge that the agent intended to do it.  This suggests that at least as far as the ordinary concept of intentional action is concerned, an agent need not intend to x in order to x intentionally.  If this is correct, then SV fails as an analysis of the folk concept of intentional action.</blockquote>

We observe that responses to the lever scenario, which result from (moral) reasoning, are affected by our manipulation; whereas responses to the stranger scenario, triggered by moral emotions, are unaffected. Furthermore, when asked to express general moral opinions on the themes of the Trolley Problem, about half of the participants reveal some inconsistency with the responses they had previously given. </blockquote>

I argue that the significance of these findings has been overstated. My discussion is two-pronged. First, I contend that barring a consensual theory of conceptual competence, the significance of these experimental findings for the nature of the concept of intentional action cannot be determined. Unfortunately, the lack of progress in the philosophy of concepts casts doubt on whether such a consensual theory will be found. Second, I propose a new, deflationary interpretation of these experimental findings, 'the trade-off hypothesis,' and I present several new experimental findings that support this interpretation. </blockquote>

This view contrasts with that of Knobe ([2006]), who argues that the findings show that the concept of intentional action invokes evaluative notions.  I discuss and reject possible objections to the moral mechanism view, and offer arguments supporting the model over Knobe's account on grounds of simplicity and plausibility.</blockquote>

These findings suggest that the moral judgments are not based on the classifications.

<blockquote>When the side effect of an action involves moral considerations (e.g. when a chairman's pursuit of proﬁts harms the environment) it tends to inﬂuence theory-of-mind judgments. On average, bad side effects are judged intentional whereas good side effects are judged unintentional. In a series of two experiments, we examined the largely uninvestigated roles of individual differences in this judgment asymmetry. Experiment 1 indicated that extraversion accounted for variations in intentionality judgments, controlling for a range of other general individual differences (e.g. working memory, self-control). Experiment 2 indicated that extraversion's inﬂuence was partially mediated by more speciﬁc variations in intentional action concepts. A priming manipulation also provided causal evidence of judgment instability and bias. Results suggest that the intentional action judgment asymmetry is multiply determined, reflecting the interplay of individual differences and judgment biases. Implications and the roles of individual differences in judgment and decision-making research are discussed. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Two studies demonstrate that a dispositional proneness to disgust ("disgust sensitivity") is associated with intuitive disapproval of gay people. Study 1 was based on previous research showing that people are more likely to describe a behavior as intentional when they see it as morally wrong (see Knobe, 2006, for a review). As predicted, the more disgust sensitive participants were, the more likely they were to describe an agent whose behavior had the side effect of causing gay men to kiss in public as having intentionally encouraged gay men to kiss publicly— even though most participants did not explicitly think it wrong to encourage gay men to kiss in public. No such effect occurred when subjects were asked about heterosexual kissing. Study 2 used the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Nosek, Banaji, &amp; Greenwald, 2006) as a dependent measure. The more disgust sensitive participants were, the more they showed unfavorable automatic associations with gay people as opposed to heterosexuals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Do moral appraisals shape judgments of intentionality? A traditional view is that individuals first evaluate whether an action has been carried out intentionally. Then they use this evaluation as input for their moral judgments. Recent studies, however, have shown that individuals' moral appraisals can also influence their intentionality attributions. They attribute intentionality to the negative side effect of a given action, but not to the positive side effect of the same action. In three experiments, we show that this asymmetry is a robust effect that critically depends on the agent's beliefs. The asymmetry is reduced when agents are described as not knowing that their action can bring about side effects, and is eliminated when they are deemed to hold a false belief about the consequences of their actions. These results suggest that both evaluative and epistemic considerations are used in intentionality attribution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Children and adults often judge that the side effects of the actions of an uncaring story agent have been intentional if the effects are harmful but not if these are beneficial, creating an asymmetrical "side-effect" effect. The authors report 3 experiments involving 4- and 5-year-olds (N 􏰄 188) designed to clarify the role of foreknowledge and caring in judgments of intentionality. Many children showed the side-effect effect even if agents were explicitly described as lacking foreknowledge of the outcome. Similarly, when agents were described as possessing foreknowledge but their caring state was unspecified, children more often judged that the negative, compared with the positive, effects of agents' actions were brought about intentionally. Regardless of foreknowledge, children infrequently judged positive outcomes as intentional when agent caring was unspecified, and they gave few attributions of intentionality when agents were described as having a false belief about the outcome. These results testify to the robustness of the side-effect effect and highlight the extent to which children's intentionality judgments are asymmetrical. The findings suggest developmental continuity in the link between reasoning about morality and intentionality.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>Recent studies by experimental philosophers demonstrate puzzling asymmetries in people's judgments about intentional action, leading many philosophers to propose that normative factors are inappropriately influencing intentionality judgments. In this paper, I present and defend the Deep Self Model of judgments about intentional action that provides a quite different explanation for these judgment asymmetries. The Deep Self Model is based on the idea that people make an intuitive distinction between two parts of an agent's psychology, an Acting Self that contains the desires, means-end beliefs, and intentions that are the immediate causal source of an agent's actions, and a Deep Self, which contains an agent's stable and central psychological attitudes, including the agent's values, principles, life goals, and other more fundamental attitudes. The Deep Self Model proposes that when people are asked to make judgments about whether an agent brought about an outcome intentionally, in addition to standard criteria proposed in traditional models, people also assess an additional 'Concordance Criterion': Does the outcome concord with the psychological attitudes of the agent's Deep Self? I show that the Deep Self Model can explain a very complex pattern of judgment asymmetries documented in the experimental philosophy 
literature, and does so in a way that has significant advantages over competing models.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This paper focuses on Joshua Knobe's experiments which show that people attribute blame and intentionality to the chairman of a company that knowingly causes harmful side effects, but do not attribute praise and intentionality to the chairman of a company that knowingly causes helpful side effects. Knobe's explanation of this data is that people determine intentionality based on the moral consideration of whether the side effect is good or bad. This observation and explanation has come to be known as the "Knobe Effect." One implication from the Knobe Effect is that it seems profit-driven businesses can only intentionally cause harmful and never good side effects. This paper examines the Knobe Effect, and argues for a way that business persons can understand it and avoid its implications. The argument has three parts. The first point is that business persons who care only about profits are blameworthy and rightly should not get credit for good side effects. Second, when a morally praiseworthy person who cares about values other than profits causes side effects, her actions are intentional and praiseworthy. Therefore, profit-driven business persons can be praised for intentionally producing good side effects if they consider other moral values as moral agents should. Finally, morally praiseworthy business persons need only to be Minimally Good Samaritans and not totally altruistic. When a business person strives for profits, adheres to other morally important values, and produces morally good side effects, then we should say that she intentionally caused those effects and is praiseworthy.</blockquote>

We report new data replicating the asymmetry in the context of scenarios wherein an agent achieves an amoral or immoral goal due to luck.

</p>
<blockquote>Theory of mind, the capacity to understand and ascribe mental states, has traditionally been conceptualized as analogous to a scientific theory. However, recent work in philosophy and 
psychology has documented a "side-effect effect" suggesting that moral evaluations influence mental state ascriptions, and in particular whether a behavior is described as having been performed 'intentionally.' This evidence challenges the idea that theory of mind is analogous to scientific psychology in serving the function of predicting and explaining, rather than evaluating, behavior. In three experiments, we demonstrate that moral evaluations do inform ascriptions of intentional action, but that this relationship arises because behavior that conforms to norms (moral or otherwise) is less informative about underlying mental states than is behavior that violates norms. This analysis preserves the traditional understanding of theory of mind as a tool for predicting and explaining behavior, but also suggests the importance of normative considerations in social cognition. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Anscombe begins her book Intention by drawing a distinction between intentions and intentional actions, noting that "we may be tempted to think that only actions done with intentions ought to be called intentional." This is an early statement of what Michael Bratman calls "the Simple View": The Simple View (SV): S -ed intentionally only if S intended to. Anscombe and Bratman both reject SV, but many philosophers have thought that it holds the key to understanding intentional action. Much of the recent work in action theory can be organized around a set of objections facing SV and other intention-based accounts of intentional action.5 My aim is to present the three most popular objections to SV and to argue that all three objections commit a common fallacy. I will then draw some more general conclusions about the connection between intentional action and moral responsibility. </blockquote>

  <blockquote> The proposal that the concept of innateness expresses a 'folk biological' theory of the 'inner natures' of organisms was tested by examining the response of biologically naive participants to a series of realistic scenarios concerning the development of birdsong. Our results explain the intuitive appeal of many of the existing philosophical analyses of the innateness concept. They simultaneously explain why all such analyses are subject to compelling counterexamples. We argue that this explanation undermines the appeal of these analyses, whether understood as analyses of the vernacular concept or as explications of that concept for the purposes of science.</blockquote>

  </p>
  <blockquote>Ethical disputes arise over differences in the content of the ethical beliefs people hold on either side of an issue. One person may believe that it is wrong to have an abortion for financial reasons, whereas another may believe it to be permissible. But, the magnitude and difficulty of such disputes may also depend on other properties of the ethical beliefs in question—in particular, how objective they are perceived to be. As a psychological property of moral belief, objectivity is relatively unexplored, and we argue that it merits more attention. We review recent psychological evidence which demonstrates that individuals differ in the extent to which they perceive ethical beliefs to be objective, that some ethical beliefs are perceived to be more objective than others, and that both these sources of variance are somewhat systematic. This evidence also shows that differences in perceptions of objectivity underpin quite different psychological reactions to ethical disagreement. 
    Apart from reviewing this evidence, our aim in this paper is to draw attention to unanswered psychological questions about moral objectivity, and to discuss the relevance of moral objectivity to two issues of public policy.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>The traditional debate about whether race should be eliminated from public discourse is often conducted in significant part by examining whether race is real. Whether race is real, in turn, often comes down to whether racial discourse purports to refer to social or natural kinds, which means that analysis of racial concepts is crucial to the question of racial eliminativism. The dominate theory of conceptual analysis in the race debate is that racial concepts should be analyzed according to how those terms have been used by historical experts. It is argued here that this dominant theory is misguided, and that we should therefore analyze racial concepts according to how they are used in contemporary, folk discourse. In addition, and in contrast to the main rival to the dominant theory, I argue that we should analyze folk racial discourse not from the armchair, but instead through empirical research.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Many hold that ordinary race-thinking in the USA is committed to the 'one-drop rule', that race is ordinarily represented in terms of essences, and that race is ordinarily represented as a biological (phenotype- and/or ancestry-based, non-social) kind. This study investigated the extent to which ordinary race-thinking subscribes to these commitments. It also investigated the relationship between different conceptions of race and racial attitudes. Participants included 449 USA adults who completed an Internet survey. Unlike previous research, conceptions of race were assessed using concrete vignettes. Results indicate widespread rejection of the one-drop rule, as well as the use of a complex combination of ancestral, phenotypic, and social (and, therefore, non-essentialist) criteria for racial classification. No relationship was found between racial attitudes and essentialism, the one-drop rule, or social race-thinking; however, ancestry-based and phenotype-based classification criteria were associated with racial attitudes. These results suggest a complicated relationship between conceptions of race and racial attitudes.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Nonmonotonic reasoning is often claimed to mimic human common sense reasoning. Only a few studies, though, have investigated this claim empirically. We report four experiments which investigate three rules of SYSTEMP, namely the AND, the LEFT LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE, and the OR rule. The actual inferences of the subjects are compared with the coherent normative upper and lower probability bounds derived from a non-infinitesimal probability semantics of SYSTEM  P. We found a relatively good agreement of human reasoning and principles of nonmonotonic reasoning. Contrary to the results reported in the 'heuristics and biases' tradition, the subjects committed relatively few upper bound violations (conjunction fallacies).</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Our theoretical understanding individual differences can be used as a tool to test and refine theory. Individual differences are useful because judgments, including philosophically relevant intuitions, are the predictable products of the fit between adaptive psychological mechanisms (e.g., heuristics, traits, skills, capacities) and task constraints.  As an illustration of this method 
    and its potential implications, our target article used a canonical, representative, and affectively charged judgment task to reveal a relationship between the heritable personality trait extraversion 
    and compatabilist judgments.  In the current comment we further clarify major theoretical implications of these data and outline potential opportunities and obstacles for this methodology.  Discussion focuses on (1) the need for theoretically grounded a priori predictions; (2) the use of precise process level data and theory; (3) the possibility of convergent validity as personality is known to predict life experiences and outcomes; and (4) the fundamentally adaptive nature of cognition. </blockquote>

The theory was tested against probability judgments for 40 arguments generated from 9 mammal categories and a common predicate.

  <blockquote>By and large, people have accepted Nozick's line as a good argument against psychological hedonism. What about his explanation? He suggested that people may be reluctant to plug in because they prefer to be in contact with reality, as though reality per se—or real experiences, if you want—have some value that virtual experiences don't. Well, in order to figure out whether people prefer a real life over a virtual life, I conducted a study in which I asked participants to imagine that they were already in a virtual reality machine, in a sort of Matrix, and then I asked them whether they would be willing to unplug and go back to reality, or if they rather wanted to remain connected. The results were quite interesting: in general (although see the paper) people preferred to remain connected. In my paper, I suggest a psychological model derived from what behavioral economists call "the status quo bias" in order to account for these results.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Many philosophers have worried about what philosophy is.  Often they have looked for answers by considering what it is that philosophers do.  Given the diversity of topics and methods found in philosophy, however, we propose a different approach.  In this article we consider the philosophical temperament, asking an alternative question: What are philosophers like?  Our answer is that one important aspect of the philosophical temperament is that philosophers are especially reflective: They are less likely than their peers to embrace what seems obvious without questioning it.  This claim is supported by a study of more than 4,000 philosophers and non-philosophers, the results of which indicate that even when we control for overall education level, philosophers tend to be significantly more reflective than their peers.  We then illustrate this tendency by considering what we know about the philosophizing of a few prominent philosophers.  Recognizing this aspect of the philosophical temperament, it is natural to wonder how philosophers came to be this way: Does philosophical training teach reflectivity or do more reflective people tend to gravitate to philosophy?  We consider the limitations of our data with respect to this question and suggest that a longitudinal study be conducted.</blockquote>

  </p>
  <blockquote>  Williams (1970) argues that our intuitions about personal identity vary depending on how a given thought experiment is framed.  Some frames lead us to think that persistence of self requires persistence of one's psychological characteristics; other frames lead us to think that the self persists even after the loss of one's distinctive psychological characteristics. The current paper takes an empirical approach to these issues.  We find that framing does affect whether or not people judge that persistence of psychological characteristics is required for persistence of self.  This difference is not explained by whether the case is framed in first or third person.  By contrast, open-ended, abstract questions about what is required for survival tend to elicit responses that appeal to the importance of psychological characteristics.  This emphasis on psychological characteristics is largely preserved even when participants are exposed to a concrete case that yields conflicting intuitions over whether memory must be preserved in order for a person is to persist. Insofar as our philosophical theory of personal identity should be based on our intuitions, the results provide some support for the view that psychological characteristics really are critical for persistence of self. </blockquote>

  <blockquote>Despite well-established results in survey methodology, many experimental philosophers have not asked whether and in what way conclusions about 'folk intuitions' follow from people's responses to their surveys. Rather, they appear to have proceeded on the assumption that intuitions can be simply read off from survey responses. Survey research, however, is fraught with difficulties. I review some of the relevant literature—particularly focusing on the conversational pragmatic aspects of survey research—and consider its application to common experimental philosophy surveys. I argue for two claims. First, that experimental philosophers' survey methodology leaves the facts about folk intuitions massively underdetermined; and second, that what has been regarded as evidence for the instability of philosophical intuitions is, at least in some cases, better accounted for in terms of subjects' reactions to subtle pragmatic cues contained in the surveys. To this effect I present new evidence from year-long survey study.</blockquote>

  <ul><li> Published five articles on intentional action, then went on to reject all the later experimental philosophy papers that were submitted. Has recently accepted two experimental philosophy papers on language since 2009.

  </p>
  <ul><li> Has published articles on moral cognition, on the relation between moral cognition and causal judgment, and on semantic intuitions. Tends to be far more interested in serious experimental research than on questions about the philosophical implications thereof. A good place to publish papers in experimental philosophy that come closer to being psychology.

  <ul><li> Published  a paper on free will and one on the impact of moral judgments on causal judgments. Tends to take a very long time to review submissions, but has shown a fair amount of openness to experimental research.

  <ul><li> Philippe Schlenker just became editor, and wants to make this journal more interdisciplinary -- going beyond work in linguistics to also include research in philosophy and psychology. A good place to try for papers that make at least some contact with the linguistics literature.

  </p>
  <ul><li> Has published an extraordinary number of papers in experimental philosophy. Tends to take a very long time in getting back to contributors, but has shown a great willingness to publish work at the intersection of philosophy and cognitive science.

  </p>
  <ul><li> Published a paper on intuitions about free will. Edited by the same team that puts together PPR, which has shown a very open-minded attitude toward experimental philosophy.

  <ul><li> Publishes reviews of existing literature, including one on moral grammar, one on experimental philosophy in general, and one on the Knobe Effect. Many of these reviews were solicited by the editors (rather than being submitted at the authors' own initiative).
