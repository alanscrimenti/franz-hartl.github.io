		<p><font size="4">Presented with this story, most subjects say that the chairman did not intentionally help the environment. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">When asked to explain their answers, subjects typically say that the chairman was not specifically <i>trying</i> to help the environment &#151; that he didn't really care about the environment either way.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">But there are other factors at work here. Subjects' responses appear to be influenced by the moral qualities of the chairman's behavior. Thus, when we replace 'help the environment' with an effect that most subjects believe to be morally objectionable, they are far more likely to say that the chairman brought this effect about intentionally.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">So, for example, in one experiment, I replaced the words 'help the environment' with 'harm the environment.' The story then came out looking like this:</font></p>
		<p>
		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="535">
			<tr>
				<td width="51"></td>
				<td>
					<center>
						<table border="4" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
							<tr>
								<td><font size="4">The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, &quot;We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									The chairman of the board answered, &quot;I don&#146;t care at all about harming the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let&#146;s start the new program.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was harmed.<br>

		<p><font size="4">Presented with this version of the story, most subjects say that the chairman did <i>intentionally </i>harm the environment. (<a href="javascript:na_open_window('win', 'stats1.html', 200, 200, 320, 220, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);">show statistics</a>)</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">This result seems to indicate that moral considerations play a role in the process by which people determine whether or not a behavior is intentional.</font></p>
