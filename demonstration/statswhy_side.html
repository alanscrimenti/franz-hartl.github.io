		Subjects' ratings of praise and blame were assessed on a scale from 0 (no praise or blame) to 6 (a lot of praise or blame).
		<p>On this scale, the mean level of blame for harming the environment was 5.3 (almost the maximum possible blame).</p>
		<p>By contrast, the mean level of praise for helping the environment was only 2.1.</p>
		<p>When we collapse across conditions, there is a correlation between people's tendency to assign a lot of praise or blame and people's tendency to consider the behavior intentional, <i>r </i>= .61, <i>p </i>&lt; .001.
