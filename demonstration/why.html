		</center>
		<p><font size="4">Why do we obtain these results? When we switch the outcome from good to bad, why do people suddenly have different intuitions about whether or not the behavior was performed <i>intentionally</i>?</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">A number of hypotheses seem plausible. Let me present just one.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Perhaps, when people are wondering whether a behavior is intentional, they ask themselves whether the person deserves blame or praise for the behavior. That is, they ask themselves whether the person stands to the behavior in a relation such he deserves praise if the behavior is good and blame if the behavior is bad.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Now, if the agent manages to hit the bull's-eye by sheer luck, it seems that the agent doesn't deserve much praise for hitting the bull's-eye. But if the agent hits his aunt by pure luck, he still deserves a great deal of blame for hitting her. And perhaps that's why people say that the agent hit the aunt intentionally but didn't hit the bull's-eye intentionally.

		<p><font size="4">Similar considerations apply to <i>side-effects </i> &#151; i.e., to effects that the agent foresaw but wasn't specifically trying to bring about. If the agent's behavior has a bad side-effect, she will usually be blamed for it. But if the agent's behavior has a good side-effect, she will not usually be praised for it. And perhaps that's why people said that the chairman intentionally brought about the bad side-effect but didn't intentionally bring about the bad side-effect.
