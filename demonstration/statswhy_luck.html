		Subjects' ratings of praise and blame were assessed on a scale from 0 (no praise or blame) to 6 (a lot of praise or blame).
		<p>On this scale, the mean level of blame for hitting the aunt by luck was 5.4 (almost the maximum possible blame).</p>
		<p>By contrast, the mean level of praise for hitting the bull's-eye by luck was only 3.4 (close to the half-way point).</p>
		<p>When we collapse across conditions, there is a correlation between people's tendency to assign a lot of praise or blame and people's tendency to consider the behavior intentional, <i>r </i>= .54, <i>p </i>&lt; .001.
