		<p><font size="4">Most subjects disagreed with the claim that Jake won the lottery intentionally. Presumably, they felt that Jake's success could not have been intentional, since it was primarily due to luck.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">In another conditon, however, subjects were asked the converse question. That is, they were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that Jake won the lottery </font><font size="4"><i>unintentionally</i>. Here too, most subjects disagreed. (<a href="javascript:na_open_window('win', 'stats3.html', 200, 200, 320, 300, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);">show statistics</a>)</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">In other words, subjects disagreed <i>both</i> with the claim that Jake won intentionally <i>and </i>with the claim that Jake won unintentionally. Subjects seemed to have classified Jake's winning of the lottery neither as intentional nor as unintentional.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">This result raises questions about our earlier findings. Earlier, we tested people's attitudes toward outcomes that they knew would result from their behavior but which they weren't specifically trying to bring about. We said that, when such an outcome is bad, people tend to say that the agent brought it about <i>intentionally</i>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">But do people really regard such outcomes as intentional? Or do they regard them neither as intentional nor as unintentional?</font></p>
