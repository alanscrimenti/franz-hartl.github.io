		<p><font size="4">Presented with this story, most subjects say that Frank doesn't think Jerry hit the triple 20 intentionally.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The key issue here seems to be that, even though Jerry was clearly trying to hit the triple 20, he didn't have the <i>skill </i>necessary to reliably transform that trying into a successful action. His success owes too much to luck.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Subjects respond very differently when presented with a vignette in which Jerry seems to have the skill to hit the triple 20 in a fairly reliable fashion: </font></p>
		<p>
		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="535">
			<tr>
				<td width="51"></td>
				<td>
					<center>
						<table border="4" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
							<tr>
								<td><font size="4">Jerry and Frank are playing darts. Jerry is a novice; he has never played darts before and is not particularly talented at games like this. </font>
									<div align="left">
										<p><font size="4">Frank explains to Jerry that he can get the most points if he<br>
										hits the triple 20, the small field shown below.<br>
										</font></p>
									</div>
									<center>
										<p><font size="4"><br>
										<img height="120" width="120" src="triple20.jpeg"></font></p>
									</center>
									<p><font size="4"><br>
									Then they start playing. Jerry says, ``Okay, so I go for the triple 20? I don't know how to do it, but I'm gonna try.'' Lo and behold, Jerry hits the triple 20 on his <b>first</b> throw. </font></p>
									<p><font size="4">Frank comments, ``Classic beginner's luck.'' </font></p>
									<p><font size="4">Jerry gets angry and says, ``What do you mean, luck? I <i>wanted</i> to hit it.'' </font></p>
									<p><font size="4">But Frank counters, ``Sure you wanted, but it was still luck. All right, show me. Hit it again!''<br>
									</font></p>
									<p><font size="4">So Jerry throws another dart and again hits the triple 20.</font></td>

		<p><font size="4">Confronted with this latter vignette, the majority of subjects say that Frank thinks Jerry hit the triple 20 intentionally. (<a href="javascript:na_open_window('win', 'statsDarts.html', 200, 200, 320, 220, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);">show statistics</a></font><font size="4">)</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Based on the results of this experiment and a number of others, Bertram Malle and I concluded that people's concept of intentional action includes a <i>skill component</i>. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">At the time, we thought that people would generally be unwilling to say that an agent acted intentionally if they thought that the agent lacked the requisite skill. </font></p>

I now think that the view we put forth in this 1997 paper was not quite
right. The chief difficulty will become clear in the next experiment.
