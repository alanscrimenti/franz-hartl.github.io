		</center>
		<p><font size="4">In this study, we examined the status of <i>side-effects</i> &#151; effects<i> </i>that the agent foresaw but wasn't specifically trying to bring about. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">A key question in the existing literature on the concept of intentional action is whether or not people consider side-effects to have been brought about intentionally. Some philosophers say that side-effects are intentional; others say that side-effects are unintentional. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">In fact, the answer seems to be somewhat more complicated. People's judgements about whether or not a side-effect is intentional seem to depend on what the particular side-effect happens to be. More specifically, it seems that people are more willing to consider a side-effect intentional if the side-effect is something bad than they are if it is something good.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Why do we obtain these results? When we switch the effect from good to bad, why do people suddenly have different intuitions about whether or not it was brought about <i>intentionally</i>?</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">A number of hypotheses seem plausible. Let me present just one.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Perhaps, when people are wondering whether or not an agent brought about some effect intentionally, they ask themselves whether or not the agent deserves praise or blame for that effect. That is, they ask themselves whether the person stands to the effect in a relation such he deserves praise if the behavior is good and blame if the behavior is bad.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Now, data from the study indicate that people blame the agent if his behavior has a bad side-effect but that they don't praise the agent if his behaivor has a good side-effect.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">And perhaps that is why people said that the chairman intentionally brought about the bad side-effect but didn't intentionally bring about the good side-effect.
