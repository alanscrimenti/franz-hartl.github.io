		<p><font size="4">Most subjects agreed with the claim that the chairman harmed the environment intentionally. (<a href="javascript:na_open_window('win', 'stats4_harm.html', 200, 200, 320, 300, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);">show statistics</a>)</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">In other words, subjects seem not to have classified the chairman's behavior neither as intentional nor as unintentional. They seem to have classified it as truly <i>intentional</i>. </font></p>
		<p><font size="4">Conversely, when subjects were told that the chairman helped the environment, most agreed with the claim that this behavior was unintentional. (<a href="javascript:na_open_window('win', 'stats4_help.html', 200, 200, 320, 300, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);">show statistics</a>) So these subjects seem to have classified the behavior as truly <i>unintentional</i>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">This result helps to address a long-standing philosophical question. Some philosophers say that side-effects are always regarded as intentional; some that side-effects are always regarded as unintentional; and some that side-effects are regarded neither as intentional nor as unintentional.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The present results seem to indicate that all of these views are overly simplistic. The truth is that some side-effects are regarded as intentional and others as unintentional, with people's intuitions varying depending on whether the side-effect itself is felt to be good or bad.</font></p>
