Past attribution research has focused on how people explain behavior;
the present paper examines which behaviors people explain. The
authors first introduce a general framework of conditions for people's
explanation of an event. This framework, applied to the domain of
behavior explanations, then predicts which behavioral events actors
and observers tend to explain. The authors distinguish between
intentional vs. unintentional and observable vs. unobservable
behavioral events, for which the framework yields three hypotheses:
(1) Actors wonder more often about unintentional and unobservable
behaviors, whereas observers wonder more often about intentional and
observable behaviors. (2) In private explanations (directed to
onself), actors explain more unintentional and unobservable behaviors,
whereas observers explain more intentional and observable behaviors.
(3) In communicative explanations (directed to other people), both
actors and observers explain more intentional and observable
behaviors. These hypotheses are supported in five studies, using
thought protocols, memory protocols, personal diaries, natural
conversations, and novels. Implications for attribution processes,
interpersonal conflict, and intimacy are discussed.
