<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>In everyday discourse, we often draw a distinction
between actions that are performed intentionally (e.g. opening your car door)
and those that are performed unintentionally (e.g. shutting a car door on your
finger).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This distinction has
interested philosophers working in a number of different areas. Indeed,
intentional actions are not only the primary focus of those concerned with
understanding and explaining human behavior, but they often occupy center stage
in philosophical discussions of free will and moral and legal responsibility as
well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>And while most philosophers
agree that the distinction between intentional and unintentional action plays an
important role in our folk psychology, there is still wide-scale disagreement
about the precise nature of this role.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Until recently, there has been a lack of empirical data about the folk
concept of intentional action and as a result the debate among philosophers has
been mostly <i>speculative</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Lately, however, a number of philosophers and psychologists have begun
making a concerted effort to fill in this empirical lacuna.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Joshua Knobe, for instance, has recently published
data that suggest that moral considerations affect people&#8217;s judgments
about whether a foreseen yet undesired side effect of an action was brought
about intentionally (2003a).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, he claims that people are &#8220;considerably more willing to say
that a side effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side
effect as bad than when they regard it is as good&#8221; (2003a: 193).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, this result does not
settle with another study of his involving folk ascriptions of intentionality
in standard cases of action that do not involve side effects (2003b).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In this second study<i>, </i>both
positive and negative moral considerations affected people&#8217;s judgments
about intentionality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>There are at least two ways to explain the
asymmetry of the results from Knobe&#8217;s experiments: <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>First, it could be that people&#8217;s
judgments about the intentionality of non-side effect actions are sensitive to
positive moral considerations in a way that their judgments about the
intentionality of side-effect actions are not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In this case we would need to explain
why negative but not positive moral considerations affect people&#8217;s
judgments concerning the intentionality of side effect actions, while both
types of consideration affect their judgments about non-side effect actions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Second, we could look for another way of
explaining the asymmetry (e.g. F. Adams and A. Steadman, forthcoming).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In this paper I take the latter route by
suggesting that Knobe gets disparate results because the two help vignettes of
his side effect experiments are not proper praiseworthy analogues to his
morally blameworthy harm vignettes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>After briefly setting the stage (&sect;I) and discussing a few of
Knobe&#8217;s experiments (&sect;II), I offer an alternative account of his
data that explains the asymmetry of his subjects&#8217; judgments in the side
effect cases (&sect;III).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Then, I
support my explanation of Knobe&#8217;s research with data from an experiment
of my own (&sect;IV), before concluding that people&#8217;s judgments about
actions &#8211; and the side effects of those actions &#8211; are affected by
both negative and positive moral considerations (&sect;V). <b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<h2>I: Setting the Stage</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
is a long-standing debate in the philosophy of action concerning the nature and
proper role of the concept of intentional action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>One of the central issues of this debate
is whether evaluative considerations do&#8212;or <i>should</i>&#8212;affect
folk ascriptions of intentional action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>While some scholars suggest that the concept of intentional action is
intimately bound up with evaluative considerations (e.g. Bratman 1987; Duff
1982; 1990; Harman 1976), others claim that because our concept of intentional
action is used primarily to <i>predict</i> and <i>explain</i> behavior,
evaluative consideration should not affect our ascriptions of intentional
action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Mele and Sverdlik (1996)
offer the most well-developed and forcefully argued defense of the view that
moral considerations should not act expansively on our ascriptions of
intentional action (see, also, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Butler</st1:place></st1:City><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>1978; Gopnik &amp; Meltzhoff 1997; Katz
1987).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On their view, philosophers
who claim that, &#8220;ordinary speakers of English are, to some extent,
properly guided by their judgments of moral responsibility in determining what
an agent did intentionally,&#8221; are wrong about the evaluative nature of <i>proper</i>
ascriptions of intentional action (Mele &amp; Sverdlik 1996, p. 270).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another
central issue of the debate about the concept of intentional action is whether
a foreseen yet undesired side effect may be brought about intentionally.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Consider, for instance, the following
example:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In the landmark <i>Smith</i>
case of 1961, jurors in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had to determine the guilt of a man named Smith who had driven a car containing
stolen goods in a zigzag course in order to shake off a policeman who had been
clinging to the side of the car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>When the policeman was finally shaken off, he rolled into oncoming
traffic and sustained fatal injuries (<i>D.P.P v. Smith</i> [1961] A.C.
290).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Imagine that you are on that
jury and your task is to decide whether Smith intentionally killed the
policeman.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>At least two questions come to
mind:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>First, can you properly say that
Smith intentionally killed the officer even though his doing so was a <i>side
effect</i> of his escaping that he neither tried nor hoped to bring about?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Second, should moral considerations
affect your judgment concerning whether he intentionally killed the officer?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On the surface, it seems that the
goodness or badness of Smith&#8217;s actions should be completely <i>irrelevant</i>
to the question of whether he performed them <i>intentionally</i>, but there is
growing evidence that ascriptions of intentional actions are often affected by
evaluative considerations (Knobe 2003a; 2003b; forthcoming; Nadelhoffer
forthcoming).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>The view that evaluative considerations do and should influence our
intuitions concerning the intentionality of side effects has received support
in the literature on intentional action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Michael Bratman, for instance, claims that a runner may intentionally
wear down the soles of his heirloom shoes even though he doesn&#8217;t intend
to do so (1987, p.123).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>As he says:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I conjectured that our inclination to extend what I
do intentionally, in the light of my belief about my sneakers, is grounded in
our interest in the ascription of responsibility.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Our scheme for classifying actions as
intentional is shaped in part by an interest in locating paradigm actions for
which agents are to be held responsible. (1987, p.136)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>And Gilbert
Harman similarly claims that a sniper may intentionally alert his enemies when
he shoots his target, even though he neither desires nor intends to alert them
(1976, p.151).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Thus, both Bratman
and Harman believe that evaluative considerations do affect folk judgments
concerning the intentionality of the side effects of an agent&#8217;s
actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In this respect, they
would likely agree with R.A. Duff&#8217;s suggestion that: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Ascriptions of&#8230;intentional agency belong with
ascriptions of responsibility and demands for justification.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>To say that A brings y about
intentionally is to say that he is responsible for its occurrence and may have
to justify his action under the description &#8220;bringing y
about&#8221;&#8230;the criteria of intentional agency as to a given effect are
also the criteria of responsibility for that effect&#8221; (1982, p. 4).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>Given this
view of the relationship between ascriptions of intentional action and
ascriptions of moral responsibility, one can <i>properly</i> be said to
intentionally bring about the foreseen, yet unintended and undesired, side
effects of one&#8217;s actions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Mele and Sverdlik, on the other hand, deny this claim and they offer an
error theory that explains why the folk may be inclined to <i>improperly</i> allow
evaluative considerations to affect their intuitions about whether the
foreseen, yet unintended and undesired, side effects of an action are
intentionally brought about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>By
their lights, while the folk may <i>correctly</i> assume that Bratman&#8217;s
runner does not unintentionally (i.e. accidentally or unknowingly) wear down
his shoes&#8212;or that Harman&#8217;s sniper does not unintentionally alert
the enemies to his presence&#8212;they incorrectly assume that because the
runner and sniper do <i>not unintentionally</i> bring about these side effects,
it follows that they must have <i>intentionally </i>brought them about.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Mele and Sverdlik claim that this
assumption is false.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they
show that there is a middle ground between unintentionally A-ing and intentionally
A-ing, <i>viz. non-intentionally A-ing</i> (1996, p. 274):</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Insofar as an agent who is A-ing is neither aiming
at A-ing nor trying to A, either as an end or as a means to an end, she is not
intentionally A-ing; insofar as an agent is A-ing knowingly and
non-accidentally, she is not unintentionally A-ing; and actions that are
neither intentional nor unintentional are nonintentional. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>(p. 274)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>Thus,
according to Mele and Sverdlik, because Bratman&#8217;s runner and
Harman&#8217;s sniper can properly be said to have brought about the respective
side effects of their actions non-intentionally, we should not say that they
brought these side effects about intentionally.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2'
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Leaving aside for the moment the normative question of whether we <i>should</i>
say that side effects are brought about intentionally, I want to consider
whether we actually <i>do</i> say so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>After all, as Mele has correctly pointed out, any adequate philosophical
analyses of intentional action should be &#8220;anchored by common-sense
judgments&#8221; about particular cases (Mele 2001:27).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Thus, one way to test an analysis of
intentional action would be to determine whether it agrees with our
pretheoretical beliefs and intuitions. And the only way of knowing what the
majority of non-specialists say about particular cases is to actually ask them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Having done so, if we find that an
analysis of intentional action entirely fails to settle with folk intuitions,
we will be in a good position to suggest that it &#8220;runs the risk of having
nothing more than a philosophical fiction as its subject matter&#8221; (Mele
2001:27).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Minimally, any
philosopher who offers an account of intentional action that is not anchored by
folk judgments would need to offer an error theory that explains how and why
the folk are misapplying the concept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>But we are getting ahead of ourselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Before we can talk about how to
interpret and explain data about folk intuitions, we should first look at
Joshua Knobe&#8217;s laudable attempts to collect them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='margin-left:0in;text-align:center'><b>II:<span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Working under the rubric of &#8220;experimental philosophy&#8221; and
motivated by the reasonable assumption that psychological experiments can shed
light on many of the crucial issues surrounding analyses of intentional action,
Knobe conducted a series of surveys.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>One of the issues that he investigated is the aforementioned question of
whether the concept of intentional action operates entirely independently of
evaluative considerations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In
answering this question, he used the four following scenarios&#8212;inspired by
Mele (2001)&#8212;to conduct a few simple experiments:</p>

the subjects with these vignettes and questions was to determine whether their
judgments about these cases were affected by evaluative considerations.<span

ascertain whether the folk are more likely to say that Jake acted intentionally
when he was attempting to perform the immoral behavior than they are when he
was attempting to perform the achievement behavior.<span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>From these
results, Knobe draws the reasonable conclusion that evaluative considerations
did affect the subjects&#8217; ascriptions of intentional action&#8212;a result
that Mele himself had explicitly predicted (Mele 2001).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, when Mele originally discussed
the four scenarios that Knobe&#8217;s vignettes are based on, he acknowledged
that the folk may &#8220;treat morally significant and morally insignificant
actions differently,&#8221; i.e. they might &#8220;have a lower threshold, for
example, for the intentionality of &#8216;lucky&#8217; actions deemed morally
wrong than for the intentionality of equally lucky actions deemed morally
neutral&#8221; (2001, p. 38).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>As we saw earlier, Mele&#8217;s explanation of this tendency is that the
folk are making &#8220;theoretical errors that taint their judgments about the
cases&#8221; (Mele, 2001, p.41).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3"

his lights, because the folk erroneously assume that if an agent is morally
responsible for having A-ed, then the agent must have A-ed intentionally, they
falsely ascribe intentionality to the actions of an agent whenever the agent
has done something morally blameworthy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>And because it is &#8220;easy enough to show people that, upon
consideration, they themselves would reject this assumption,&#8221; their
tendency to allow evaluative considerations to affect ascriptions of
intentionality is both mistaken and easily corrected (Mele, 2001, p.41).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Thus, Mele suggests that we could
disabuse the folk of their mistaken reliance on evaluative considerations by
reminding them of cases of negligence and recklessness where the agent is still
morally responsible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Once they are reminded
of these types of cases, they will purportedly see that the assumption that
blameworthy actions must be intentional is &#8220;false by their own lights
rather than by the lights of an externally imposed theory&#8221; (Mele 2001,
p.41).</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
test Mele&#8217;s prediction, Knobe conducted yet another experiment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This time, he &#8220;causes subjects to
believe that actions can be blameworthy even if they aren&#8217;t
intentional&#8221; and tests to see whether they say that immoral/no-skill
behavior is intentional (2003a, p.317).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Once again, Knobe followed Mele&#8217;s suggested method of achieving
this effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>He first exposed the
subjects to the following vignette&#8212;taken directly from Mele (2001,
p.41)&#8212;involving a person who does something that is clearly both <i>unintentional</i>
and <i>morally blameworthy</i>:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bob got rip-roaring drunk at a party after
work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>When the party ended, he
stumbled to his car and started driving home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>He was very drunk at the time&#8212;so
drunk that he eventually lost control of his car, swerved into oncoming
traffic, and killed a family of five.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>Each
subject was presented with two vignettes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>On the first page was the vignette involving Bob&#8217;s drunken driving
scenario, and on the second page was one of the vignettes from the previous
study involving the no-skill conditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>As was expected, 96% of the subjects said that Bob&#8217;s behavior was
unintentional, yet when the subjects were asked to rate Bob&#8217;s
blameworthiness on a scale from 0 (no blame) to 6 (a lot of blame), the mean
rating was 5.3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So, obviously the
subjects understood that people can&#8212;and presumably should&#8212;be held
responsible for immoral yet unintentional actions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But the more important question is
whether the subjects of this revised experiment answered the questions about
the second vignettes differently than earlier subjects who had not been
reminded of this possibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>And
the results show that the answer to this question is &#8220;no.&#8221;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the subjects&#8217; responses to
the questions concerning the second vignettes showed the same asymmetry as
before: 84% said the immoral behavior was intentional, whereas only 40% judged
that the achievement behavior was intentional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Once again, Knobe&#8217;s results were
statistically significant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>And as
Mele himself has subsequently admitted, the asymmetry of the folk judgments in
this study spells &#8220;bad news&#8221; for his earlier hypothesis that if the
folk do allow evaluative considerations to shape their ascriptions of
intentional action, it is only because they overlook the fact that they can
hold people morally responsible for unintentional actions in cases of
negligence or recklessness (Mele, 2003, p.334).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4'

intuitions about the intentionality of foreseeable yet undesired side effects
are similarly influenced by moral considerations (Knobe, 2003a).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The subjects of his first side effect

of the board and said, &#8216;We are thinking of starting a new program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>It will help us increase profits, but it
will also harm the environment.&#8217;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>The chairman of the board answered, &#8216;I don&#8217;t care at all
about harming the environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I
just want to make as much profit as I can.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>The

another side-effect experiment, Knobe got similar results.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This time the subjects received one of
the following two vignettes:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>Harm Condition:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A lieutenant was talking with a sergeant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The lieutenant gave the order:
&#8216;Send your squad to the top of Thompson Hill.&#8217;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The sergeant said: &#8216;But if I send

them will surely be killed!&#8217;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>The lieutenant answered: &#8216;Look, I know that they&#8217;ll be in
the line of fire, and I know that some of them will be killed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But I don&#8217;t care at all about what
happens to our soldiers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>All I care

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>Once again,
the harm and the help conditions yielded drastically different responses:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>77% of the subjects who read the harm
condition said the agent intentionally brought about the negative side effect,
whereas only 30% of the subjects who read the help condition said the agent
brought about the positive side effect intentionally (2003a: 192).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>When Knobe combined the praise and blame
ratings from the two experiments, he got the following results:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Whereas the subjects who were given the
harm condition said the agent deserved a lot of blame (M=4.8), the subjects who
were given the help condition said that the agent deserved virtually no praise
(M=1.4).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, these results
were correlated with their judgments about whether or not the side effect was brought
about intentionally (2003a: 193).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Knobe claims that: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There seems to be an asymmetry whereby people are
considerably more willing to blame the agent for bad side effects than to
praise the agent for good side effects.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>And this asymmetry in people&#8217;s assignment of praise and blame may
be at the root of the corresponding asymmetry in people&#8217;s application of
the concept intentionally: namely, that they seem considerably more willing to
say that a side effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that
side effect as bad than when they regard it as good. (2003a, p.193)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>On the
surface, Knobe&#8217;s conclusion appears to be well supported by his data, but
I am now going to show that we have good reason to doubt whether this is
actually the case.</p>

line-height:200%'><b>III:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>An
Alternative Explanation<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'><b><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b>Because
Knobe&#8217;s harm conditions elicited significantly different results than the
help conditions, he concludes that the subjects&#8217; ascriptions of
intentionality were affected by the moral badness of the side effects of the
former but not the moral goodness of the side effects of the latter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he claims that whereas bad
side effects appear to act expansively on the subjects&#8217; ascriptions of
blame, good side effects do not have similar effects on their ascriptions of
praise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>It is my contention that
there is an alternative way of explaining the asymmetry of Knobe&#8217;s
data.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On my view &#8211; which at
least in this one respect is similar to the one offered by Adams and Steadman
(forthcoming) &#8211; Knobe gets disparate results because his praiseworthy
help conditions are not proper analogues for his blameworthy harm conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In order to see why this is the case, we should first look at
Knobe&#8217;s harm conditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>For
instance, when we read that the CEO doesn&#8217;t care that his plans will harm
the environment, it is natural &#8211; and seemingly justified &#8211; for us
to form a negative evaluation of the CEO.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, when we read that the lieutenant in the harm condition does
not care about putting his soldiers in the line of fire we understandably form
a negative evaluation of the lieutenant. In both cases, because the two
respective agents do not care about something that it is clear that they should
care about we view them in an unfavorable light.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This negative evaluation presumably explains
subjects&#8217; willingness to a) blame the CEO and the lieutenant in the harm
conditions, and b) to say that the negative side effects of their respective
actions were brought about intentionally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
we take a closer look at Knobe&#8217;s help conditions, however, we quickly
find that the respective agents are not genuinely praiseworthy, as they would
need to be in order for the help conditions to be isomorphic with the harm
conditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>As Adams and Steadman
correctly point out, &#8220;the language of the harm conditions seems natural
(if uncaring), but the language in the help condition seems highly
strained&#8221; (forthcoming). For instance, when we read that the CEO does not
care that his plans will help the environment, we are not inclined to view his
lack of concern favorably.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>After
all, even the greediest corporate executive would presumably be pleased to find
out that a business plan will not only yield a huge profit, but that it will
also help the environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So, the
natural reaction &#8211; i.e. the reaction we would expect from such a CEO
&#8211; would be, &#8220;Great!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You
mean to tell me that not only am I going to make large sums of money, but I
will also be helping the environment as well?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t have planned this any
better!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This should keep the EPA
off our backs for a while!&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>And the same thing can be said in the case of the lieutenant who
curiously &#8211; and seemingly callously &#8211; doesn&#8217;t care that his
soldiers will be removed from the line of fire.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Once again, we expect a very different
response.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Rather than not caring at
all about the welfare of his soldiers, we expect him to say something like,
&#8220;Great!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You mean that not
only will I take Thompson Hill, but in doing so I will actually be saving my
soldiers&#8217; lives?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Things
couldn&#8217;t have turned out any better!&#8221;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In both of these cases it is precisely because we find the agent&#8217;s
lack of concern very puzzling and highly inappropriate that we form negative
evaluations of them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In this
respect the harm conditions and the help conditions are quite similar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in all four cases we do not form
good opinions of the respective agents because each of them does not care about
something that we think they should care about.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>By my lights, this not only explains why
the subjects who received the harm conditions <i>did</i> judge that the agents
deserved to be blamed for bringing about bad side effects, but it also explains
why the subjects who received the help conditions <i>did not</i> judge that the
agents deserved to be praised for bringing about good side effects.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Thus, Knobe&#8217;s conclusion &#8211; <i>viz.</i>, that people&#8217;s
judgments about the intentionality of side effects are affected by negative but
not positive moral considerations &#8211; fails to follow from his data.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On my view, the results of his side
effect experiments show that insofar as subjects judge that an <i>agent</i> is
blameworthy, they are more inclined to say that any <i>negative</i> side
effects brought about by the agent are intentional and any <i>positive</i> side
effects brought about by the agent are not intentional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Presumably this is because if the
subjects who read one of the help conditions said that the side effects were
brought about intentionally, they would have felt compelled to say that the
agent deserved praise for intentionally bringing them about &#8211; something
they were loathe to do insofar as they viewed the agents in the help conditions
in a very negative light owing to their blatant lack of concern.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But to the extent that even
Knobe&#8217;s <i>help</i> conditions involve <i>morally blameworthy agents</i>,
his data do not rule out the possibility that if people were presented with a <i>morally
praiseworthy agent</i> who brought about positive side effects, they would be
inclined to judge that the agent brought about the side effects of her action
intentionally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

line-height:200%'><b>IV: Praise and Side Effects: A New Experiment<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>To see whether praise could affect people&#8217;s judgments about the
intentionality of the side effects of an agent&#8217;s actions I conducted a
simple experiment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The subjects
were 40 undergraduates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Each
received the following vignette:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'>Imagine that
Steve and Jason are two friends who are competing against one another in an
essay competition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Jason decides to
help Steve edit his essay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Ellen, a
mutual friend, says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize that if you help Steve, you
will decrease your own chances of winning the competition?&#8221;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Jason responds, &#8220;I know that
helping Steve decreases my chances of winning, but I don&#8217;t care at all
about that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I just want to help my
friend!&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, Steve
wins the competition because of Jason&#8217;s help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'>Then each of the
subjects received the following two questions:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>First, did Jason intentionally decrease
his own chances of winning the competition by helping Steve?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'>Second, how much
praise does Jason deserve on a scale from 0 to 6 &#8211; 0 being no praise and
6 being a lot of praise &#8211; for decreasing his chances of winning in order
to help his friend?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The results
were as follows:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>55% of the
subjects judged that Jason <i>intentionally </i>decreased his chances of
winning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the average
praise rating for those who said that he intentionally decreased his chances of
winning intentionally was 4.0, whereas the average praise rating for those who
said that he did not intentionally decrease his chances was only 2.5.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is a positive correlation
between how much praise subjects attributed to Jason and whether they judged
that the side effect was brought about intentionally.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When
we compare the results of my side effect experiment with Knobe&#8217;s data we
get the following results: whereas 55% of my subjects judged that Jason brought
about the side effect intentionally and they gave Jason a total praise rating
of M=3.3, only 26.5% of the subject in Knobe&#8217;s CEO and lieutenant cases
judged that the side effects were brought about intentionally and they gave the
respective agents an average praise rating of M=1.4.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I suggest that the best explanation of
the asymmetry between the results of my experiment and Knobe&#8217;s two
experiments is that in my help vignette <i>Jason&#8217;s lack of concern is
itself morally praiseworthy</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>So, when my subjects read that Jason cares more about helping his friend
than about winning the competition &#8211; an admirable and noble lack of
concern &#8211; they were presumably inclined to view him in a very favorable
light.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This explains why the
subjects in my experiment were much more likely to judge that Jason deserved
praise and thus that the side effects of his actions were brought about
intentionally.</p>

<h1>V:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Given
that I have successfully shown that praise acts expansively on people&#8217;s
judgments concerning whether a side effect was brought about intentionally and
provided that Knobe has shown a) that both blame and praise affect
people&#8217;s ascriptions of intentionality in standard <i>non-side effect</i>
cases (2003b; see also AUTHOR, forthcoming), and b) that blame affects
people&#8217;s ascriptions of intentionality in <i>side effect</i> cases (2003a),
we are now in a better position to conclude that both positive and negative
moral considerations affect people&#8217;s application of the concept <i>intentional</i>.<a

hope this paper serves as another small stepping-stone in that direction.<a

decision in this case was based on what has come to be known as the
&#8220;objective standard.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>The jurors were instructed to find Smith guilty of capital murder so
long as a &#8220;reasonable person&#8221; could have foreseen the
death&#8212;or grievous bodily harm&#8212;of the police officer, even if Smith
didn&#8217;t actually foresee the officer&#8217;s death.<span

to the jury suggested that if a reasonable person could have foreseen the
death, then Smith intended the death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Not surprisingly, the jury found Smith guilty of capital murder&#8212;a
verdict that prompted England to pass the Criminal Justice Act of 1967 in an attempt
to prevent similar verdicts in the future. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>According to this Act, &#8220;a court or
jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offense, (a) shall not
be bound by law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by
reason only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions;
but (b) shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference
to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper
in the circumstances.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Thus, a
