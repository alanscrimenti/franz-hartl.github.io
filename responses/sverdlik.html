<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The concept of
intentional action occupies a central place in commonsense or folk
psychological thought. Philosophers of action, psychologists and moral
philosophers all have taken an interest in understanding this important
concept. One issue that has been discussed by philosophers is whether the
concept of intentional action is purely ‘naturalistic’, that is, whether it is
entirely a descriptive concept that can be used to explain and predict
behavior. (Of course, judgments using such a concept could be used to support
moral or evaluative judgments about responsibility, praise and blame.) A
related question is whether speakers’ views about moral and evaluative issues
at least affect their judgments about intentionality, even if their explicit
concept of intentional action is not itself evaluative. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The folk
psychological concept of intentional action has a number of components. These
include the agent’s desire or interest in producing an effect, her control over
the production of this effect, and her belief about the likelihood of her
producing the effect. (Mele and Moser 1994) We can ask whether moral or
evaluative considerations influence how people interpret each of these
components. Consider the component of the agent’s desire or interest in
performing the action or producing a certain effect. This component is related
to a distinction we commonly make about the effects of action. We distinguish
between effects that an agent produces intentionally and other effects of her
action that she may foresee but does not produce intentionally. For example, an
agent could intentionally start her car by turning the ignition key, and
foresee that the car will make noise as a result of the ignition, where she has
no desire or interest in making this noise. In this case we say that she knew
that her action would produce the noise, but that she did not produce it
intentionally. It might be suggested here that speakers say that a foreseen
effect that is not desired—a so-called ‘side’ or ‘double’ effect like the noise
from the engine’s starting---was produced intentionally if they believe that
the agent is morally responsible for it. Mele and Sverdlik (1996) examined the
arguments in the philosophical literature purporting to show this sort of
influence on people’s use of ‘intentional’. They contended that none of these
arguments is convincing. This means that speakers are perfectly capable of
saying that an agent did not produce a bad effect intentionally, but is morally
responsible for it, and that an agent did produce a bad effect intentionally
but is not responsible for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Joshua Knobe, in
an interesting series of papers, began empirical investigations of this and
related questions about the concept of intentional action. (Knobe 2003a; Knobe
2003b; Knobe 2004; Knobe and Mendlow 2004) When he asked subjects questions
about the agents in described scenarios—one of which is presented below---he
found evidence that the subjects’ views about responsibility and value do, in
fact, affect their judgments about intentionality. Where subjects believe that
an agent is morally responsible for a bad side effect they are inclined to say
that she produced it intentionally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Knobe also found that there is an asymmetry in the way that subjects
connect responsibility and intentionality in cases of good and bad side
effects: speakers are more likely to say that a bad side effect is produced
intentionally than they are to say that a good side effect is produced
intentionally. </p>

<h1 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-weight:normal'>This
paper describes two psychological experiments designed by the author and Joshua
Knobe. The experiments investigate further some questions that arose from his
work on responsibility and intentionality beliefs in folk psychology. They show
that there is reason to doubt that subjects’ beliefs about the intentionality
of side effects are simply a product of their beliefs about the agent’s
responsibility for these effects. The author also considers how the
experimental results bear on Knobe’s most recent views about the relation of
subjects’ value judgments about side effects and their intentionality
judgments. What the experimental results suggest is that subjects do not simply
use either their belief that a side effect is bad, or that the agent is
responsible for it, to determine their view about the intentionality of its
production.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<h1 style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></h1>

<h1 style='line-height:150%'><u>Experiment 1<o:p></o:p></u></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Design</u> </b>Knobe (2003a)
found that subjects are influenced in their descriptions of side effects as
intentionally produced or not by their beliefs about whether the agent
described is to be blamed (or is responsible) for those effects. One of the
scenarios he presented to his subjects is the following, which will be called <i>Indifference</i>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of
the board and said, “We are thinking of starting a new program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It will help us increase profits, but it will
also harm the environment.”<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The chairman of the board answered, “I don’t care at all
about harming the environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just
want to make as much profit as I can.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let’s start the new program.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>They started the new program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure enough, the environment was harmed.</b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Knobe found that 82% of his
subjects said that the chairman brought about the side effect intentionally.
This is surprising, given the fact that the scenario gives us no reason to
suppose that he desired to harm, or had an interest in harming, the
environment. A related surprising finding involved the production of good side
effects. Knobe found that when the same subjects were presented with a scenario
exactly like this one, except for the substitution of ‘help’ for ‘harm’’, 77%
said that the chairman did not produce the side effect intentionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The present
experiment was designed to investigate further some of Knobe’s findings. One
question that arose about <i>Indifference</i> was whether the response to it
was due to the specific mental attitude that the chairman is implied to have.
The chairman seems to be (outrageously) indifferent to the harm that will result
from his action. It is possible that subjects would be less likely to say that
a foreseen harm is produced intentionally when it is made clear that the agent
is reluctant to produce it, and regrets it, after the fact. This sort of
situation is captured in the following scenario, which will be called<b> </b><i>Regret</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><b>Jones normally mows his lawn
every week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But during the summer he and
his family take a two-week vacation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
day before they leave, Jones realizes that he has not mowed the lawn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to do that before they leave for the
airport, he has to mow at 7 AM on Sunday.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Jones thinks: “If I mow the lawn at 7 AM, I’ll be waking
up the neighbors, but I can’t see leaving the lawn unmowed for two weeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Well, I really hate to wake them up, but I
guess there’s just no way around it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jones wakes up early on Sunday and does the mowing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While he is on his vacation, Jones feels bad
about having woken up the neighbors.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><i>Regret</i> and
the questions about it were also designed to make the subjects consider the
general possibility that an agent is morally responsible for a bad result that
she does not produce intentionally. We wondered whether subjects in Knobe
(2003) who read <i>Indifference</i> were reasoning that the chairman must have
produced the harm intentionally <u>because</u> he was responsible for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>In this experiment
the control condition consisted of <i>Indifference</i>, along with three
questions about it. The experimental condition consisted of two scenarios, the
first being <i>Regret</i>, with the same three questions, the second being <i>Indifference</i>,
along with the three questions. The questions asked whether the agent described
believed that he was producing the relevant effect; whether he intentionally
produced that effect; and whether he was responsible for producing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>We had two
hypotheses. We predicted that fewer subjects would say about Jones that he
intentionally awoke his neighbors than would say that the chairman
intentionally harmed the environment. We also predicted that after the subjects
in the experimental condition encountered (in <i>Regret</i>) the conceptual
possibility of foreseeing a harmful result while being reluctant to produce it,
they would be less likely than subjects in the control group to say of the
chairman (in <i>Indifference</i>) that he produced the harm intentionally. On
the other hand, it was hypothesized that the subjects in the second condition
would be just as likely as the control subjects to say that the executive was
responsible for the harm.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2"

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Discussion</u></b> There are
some noteworthy features of our results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>First, we found
that a much smaller percentage of subjects who read <i>Indifference</i> (in the
control condition) answered that the chairman produced the harm intentionally
than did subjects in Knobe (2003a). Knobe found 82% of his subjects said that
the chairman produced the harm intentionally. We found that only 44% of the
subjects in the control condition said this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Second, it is
indeed noteworthy that a smaller percentage of the subjects in the experimental
condition said that Jones produced the bad side effect intentionally than said
(in the control condition) that the chairman produced the side effect
intentionally. 24% of the subjects in <i>Regret</i> said that Jones produced
the result intentionally; 44% in the control condition said that the chairman
produced the harm intentionally. This supports our first hypothesis. It is not
simply an agent’s foreseeing of a bad side effect that is playing a role in
subject’s responses, but also whether the agent is indifferent to it, or is
reluctant to produce it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Third, if we
consider the subjects who say that the agent in the scenario is responsible for
the side effect, there is a significant difference in the two cases. A higher
percentage of the subjects in the control condition of <i>Indifference</i> said
that the chairman was responsible <u>and</u> produced the effect intentionally
than said of <i>Regret</i> that Jones produced the effect intentionally and was
responsible for it. In the control condition of <i>Indifference</i>, 45% of the
subjects who gave a ‘yes’ answer to the responsibility question also said that
the executive produced the result intentionally. Hence, 55% of those saying he
was responsible for the effect said he did not produce it intentionally. Only
22% of the subjects who said that Jones was responsible for waking the
neighbors also said that he did this intentionally. Thus, 78% of those saying
he was responsible for a bad side effect said he did not produce it
intentionally. This result certainly suggests that it is incorrect to assert
that subjects who believe that an agent is morally responsible for a bad side
effect also suppose that this agent produced the effect intentionally. It does,
however, support the conclusion that subjects are more likely to say that an
agent produces a bad side effect intentionally when he seems indifferent to it,
as compared to an agent who produces a bad side effect with reluctance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Fourth, our second
hypothesis was disconfirmed. The subjects in the experimental condition were <u>more</u>,
not less, likely to say of <i>Indifference</i> that the chairman produced the
harm intentionally. 44% of the control subjects said that the chairman produced
the harm intentionally, whereas 60% of the subjects in the experimental
condition said this. Also, the percentage of subjects who said the chairman was
responsible that also said he produced the result intentionally went from 45%
of the control subjects to 60% of the subjects in the experimental condition.
Perhaps this could still be attributed to the effect of the factor under
consideration, though. That is, we hypothesized that once the subjects were
clearly confronted with the possibility that an agent is responsible for a
result that he does not desire to produce—and this possibility is evident in a
case where the agent is reluctant to produce a foreseen effect—they would be
more likely to say that the chairman did not produce the harm intentionally,
but was responsible for it. But the description in <i>Regret</i>, where Jones
is reluctant to wake up his neighbors, may actually have highlighted the fact
that the chairman does not have such reluctance, and thereby increased the
subjects’ inclination to say that the chairman produced the harm intentionally.
Note, however, that even after considering <i>Regret</i> 39% of the subjects
said that the chairman in <i>Indifference</i> did <u>not</u> produce the harm
intentionally. And 40% of the subjects who said ‘responsible’ of the chairman
said that he did not produce harm intentionally. So the connection between
responsibility and intentionality is not tight, even when the agent foresees a
bad side effect and is indifferent to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>A further point
can be made with some hesitation. This experiment investigated the relationship
between the subjects’ beliefs about intentionality and responsibility with
respect to side effects. Recently, Knobe and Mendlow (2004) have defended a
somewhat different claim from that in Knobe (2003a). In response to Nadelhoffer
they have suggested that the idea that influences subjects’ responses about
intentionality is not responsibility (including praise and blame judgments),
but rather simply beliefs about the goodness or badness of the foreseen
effects. The two views are different, since it is possible, for example, that
an agent foresees a bad effect and produces it, but deserves no blame for doing
so. The example that Knobe and Mendlow use to exemplify this involves an
executive who makes a decision knowing it will reduce sales in one area, but
will also increase sales in another area by a greater amount. They found that
subjects do not assert that the executive is to be blamed for reducing the
sales, and yet they largely say that she intentionally reduced the sales. Knobe
and Mendlow conclude that what is influencing the subjects’ responses is the
belief that the reduction is bad. Now the experiment we ran did not ask the
subjects about their beliefs about whether waking the neighbors in <i>Regret</i>
is a bad thing. But it is surely reasonable to suppose that they did believe
this. Indeed it is plausible to think that judgments asserting blame or
‘negative’ responsibility for the production of an effect entail judgments that
the result is a bad thing. (Examples such as the executive in Knobe and Mendlow
(2004) show that the converse entailment does not hold.) Therefore, it seems
reasonable to hold that the results from <i>Regret</i> in our experiment tell
against an unqualified version of the claim in Knobe and Mendlow (2004). That
is, they tell against the claim that subjects who believe that an agent
knowingly produces an effect that the subjects believe is bad will say that the
agent produced it intentionally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h1 style='line-height:150%'><u>Experiment 2<o:p></o:p></u></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Design</u></b> In this
experiment we further investigated the role of the state of mind of the agent
described in the scenario. There is a distinction between indifference to a
foreseen bad effect and reluctance to produce it. But there is at least one
other possible attitude that an agent can have towards a foreseen bad result:
she can actively try to prevent or minimize it.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3'
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

(In contrast, of course, she can welcome it.) The author hypothesized that
subjects who read a description of an agent who exhibits this sort of attitude
towards a foreseen effect of her action will be even less inclined to describe
her production of the effect as intentional than they would an agent who is
reluctant to produce the effect but does nothing to prevent it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
experiment had two conditions. The control condition consisted of <i>Regret</i>,
followed by two questions, instead of three. The first asked whether Jones
intentionally woke up his neighbors; the second asked whether Jones was to
blame for waking up his neighbors. The experimental condition consisted of a
new scenario about a dentist, Smith, along with two questions. Let us call this
scenario <i>Prevention</i>. With <i>Prevention</i> we had some subjects answer
the question about blame first, and the question about intentionality second. Other
subjects answered these questions in reverse order. Having both orders could
clarify whether subjects who first describe an agent as ‘to blame’ (or
responsible) are more likely to describe her also as intentionally producing
the result, than subjects who consider intentionality first. We found no
significant difference in the two groups, so their responses are amalgamated in
the following table. Here is <i>Prevention</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Discussion</u></b> One
notable feature of this experiment is that the percentage of subjects who say
that Jones intentionally woke up his neighbors is 45%, whereas in the first
experiment only 24% said this. There seems to be some significant variation on
this point. On the other hand, 22% of the subjects in the first experiment who considered
<i>Regret</i> said that Jones was responsible for waking up his neighbors and
did so intentionally (i.e., gave two ‘yes’ answers), while 30% of the subjects
in this experiment who considered that scenario gave two ‘yes’ answers. On this
point, the responses of the two sets of subjects are close.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the experimental condition it is striking that 26% of the subjects said that
Smith is to blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain. The response about blame or responsibility attributed to Smith is
markedly different from the blame attributed to Jones. 77% of the subjects in
the control section of this experiment said of Jones that he was ‘to blame’ for
waking up his neighbors. In the first experiment, 78% of the subjects asked
about this said that Jones was ‘responsible’ for waking them up. This might be
seen as confirming the suggestion that subjects have less inclination to
attribute blame to an agent who takes steps to prevent a foreseen bad effect.
But there are other differences between the two cases. For one thing, Smith secures
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
consent to operate; Jones does not secure his neighbors’ consent to mow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
results of the second experiment confirm subjects’ ability to separate the
ideas of responsibility and intentionality, although in some surprising ways.
In <i>Regret</i> most subjects said that Jones was to blame for waking his
neighbors. 58% of those who said that Jones was to blame for waking his
neighbors said that he did not wake them intentionally. Most of the subjects in
the Smith scenario said that Smith was not to blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s pain. But 71% of the subjects who
said that Smith is to blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain said that she did not produce it intentionally. So in both experiments the
majority of subjects who attribute blame or responsibility also say that the
agent did not produce the relevant effect intentionally. But a number of
subjects in the second condition of this experiment make a different sort of
conceptual separation. 33 subjects said that Smith produced <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s pain intentionally, and 27 of these
(81%) also said that she was not to blame for it. You could certainly say that
these 27 subjects separate the questions of intentionality and responsibility.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

The author was interested in cases where agents affirm the presence of
responsibility but deny the presence of intentionality. He had focused on <i>Regret</i>
as a way to bring home to the subjects that it is possible to be responsible
for a bad side effect without intentionally bringing it about. And the two
presentations of <i>Regret</i> showed a significant number of subjects making
the distinction in this way. The author would not have predicted that many
subjects who considered <i>Prevention</i> would have said that Smith
intentionally produces <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain but is not to blame for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The question of
the separability of intentionality and responsibility is related to the new
proposal found in Knobe and Mendlow (2004). They suggest that the operative
factor in subjects’ thinking about intentionality in these sorts of cases is
the badness of the side effects rather than the issue of the agent’s
blameworthiness or responsibility. Again, there is a problem with their
proposal. Presumably all the subjects regard <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s pain as bad. But 59% of them said
that Smith did not produce <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain intentionally, which disconfirms their hypothesis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>There are some
other surprising results of this experiment. One is that 26% of the subjects in
<i>Prevention</i> said that Smith was to blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s pain. We would not have supposed
that any subjects would have given this response. The author is inclined to
think that one of the sources for these results was the use of the word
‘blame’. We had intended to use a more colloquial synonym for ‘morally
responsible’, but it may be that the causal meaning of the word ‘blame’ was the
one employed by some of the subjects. In the sentence ‘The storm was to blame
for the power outage’ the word ‘blame’ has a causal meaning. (The word
‘responsible’ also has this meaning.) So perhaps some of those subjects who
agreed with the statement that Smith was to blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s pain only meant that Smith was the
cause of it. We might have gotten a different response rate if we had asked
whether Smith deserved any blame for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
most surprising result was that 41% of the subjects in <i>Prevention</i> said
that Smith produced <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain intentionally. Compare this to the 44% of the subjects in the control
condition of the first experiment who said that the chairman in <i>Indifference</i>
produced the harm intentionally, and the 45% of the subjects in the control
condition of this experiment who said that Jones woke up his neighbors
intentionally. (On the other hand, as was noted, only 24% of the subjects in
the experimental condition of the first experiment said that Jones woke up his
neighbors intentionally.) We expected the percentage of subjects considering <i>Prevention</i>
who said that Smith produced <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain intentionally to be smaller than the percentage of subjects considering
Jones who said that he woke up his neighbors intentionally. Thus, our hypothesis
was disconfirmed. Smith takes steps to avoid a bad side effect whereas Jones is
reluctant to produce a bad side effect, but takes no steps to avoid it, and yet
about the same percentage of subjects said that Smith produced the bad effect
intentionally as said that Jones produced the bad effect intentionally. The
author has no explanation for the high percentage of subjects who say that
Smith produced <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain intentionally. It is important to remind ourselves, however, that 59% said
that she did not produce it intentionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>It is clear that
subjects are able, in general, to separate the idea of responsibility for an
effect from the idea that it is produced intentionally. That is, they are able
to ascribe one of these concepts to an agent’s behavior while withholding the
other, even when the issue is a bad side effect. In the case of a bad side
effect, we found cases where subjects will say that an agent did not produce
the effect intentionally but is responsible for it. So, in <i>Regret</i> in the
first experiment, 76% of the subjects said that Jones did not produce the
result intentionally, but 78% said that he was responsible for it. And,
furthermore, only 22% of the subjects who did say that Jones was responsible
for waking his neighbors thought that he did this intentionally. There was a
surprising confirmation of this general point about conceptual separability in
the responses to <i>Prevention</i>. 21 subjects said that Smith was to blame
for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>’s
pain. 71% of these subjects said that she did not produce his pain
intentionally. (But it is possible that the ‘blame’ here is not a moral
notion.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>It seems
reasonable to conclude, further, that subjects are able to distinguish the
question of the badness of a foreseen effect from the question of the
intentionality of the production of it. We did not ask our subjects whether
they regarded harm to the environment, waking up one’s neighbors on Sunday
morning, or pain as bad. But it is reasonable to think that they all believe
that these effects are bad. Yet 56% of the subjects in the control condition of
the first experiment said that the chairman’s production of the harm was not
intentional; 76% of the subjects in the experimental condition of this
experiment said that Jones’ waking of the neighbors was not intentional; 55% of
the subjects in the second experiment said that Jones’ waking of the neighbors
was not intentional; and 59% of the subjects in the second experiment said that
Smith’s production of Taylor’s pain was not intentional. (It was only in the
experimental condition of the first experiment that a bare majority, 60%, said
that the executive harmed the environment intentionally.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The author had
supposed that a critical variable affecting the subjects’ views about
intentionality would be the attitude ascribed to the agent in the scenario.
This seemed to be only partly confirmed. In the first experiment a
substantially smaller percentage of subjects said that Jones woke his neighbors
intentionally than said the chairman harmed the environment intentionally (24%
versus 44%), and this difference might well be explained by saying that Jones
is described as reluctant to wake his neighbors while the chairman is
indifferent to the harm to the environment. But in the second experiment what
seems like an analogous difference had virtually no effect. One might suppose
that efforts to prevent a bad side effect bespeak an even stronger aversion to
it than does mere reluctance to produce it, and yet 41% of the subjects said
that Smith produced <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Taylor</st1:City></st1:place>’s
pain intentionally and 45% said that Jones woke his neighbors intentionally. So
we can either conclude that the attitudinal factor reaches a sort of threshold
of effectiveness when subjects conclude that the agent is reluctant to produce
the side effect, or that they are not seeing efforts to prevent the side effect
as an augmentation of the aversion found in reluctance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>In only one of the
experimental conditions did a majority of the subjects say that the agent
intentionally produced the bad side effect. So it is safe to say that we did
not find Knobe’s hypotheses about the influence of responsibility and badness
judgments on intentionality judgments to be strongly confirmed. The author’s
hypothesis that the subjects’ beliefs about the agent’s attitude toward the
side effect influence their intentionality judgments was not strongly
confirmed, either. It is, of course, likely that all three factors have some
influence on the responses of some subjects in some cases, since a purely
‘naturalistic’ notion of intentionality would probably not lead anyone to say
that the chairman in <i>Indifference</i> produces the harm intentionally.</p>
