    <p>We are pleased to announce the new Oxford Studies in Experimental Philosophy series, published by Oxford University Press and edited by Joshua Knobe, Tania Lombrozo, and Shaun Nichols. The series joins other successful volumes in the <i>Oxford Studies inâ€¦</i> series, which bring together original articles on all aspects of their respective topics. Oxford Studies in Experimental Philosophy will publish a volume every two years, featuring outstanding papers at the cutting edge of experimental philosophy as well as papers that engage in critical discussion of the field. Philosophers and scientists alike are invited to contribute. 

    <p>We are currently soliciting abstracts for proposed contributions to the first volume. Abstracts should be no more than 1,000 words, and should be submitted to oxford.xphi@gmail.com by December 15, 2011. Abstracts should include a full author list, institutional affiliations, contact information and a summary of the proposed paper. Proposals for experimental papers should include a brief summary of the methods and results of the experiments reported. 


<p>Authors will be notified whether they are invited to submit a complete manuscript by February 15, 2012, with full papers due on August 15, 2012. Submissions will undergo a review process prior to final publication.
