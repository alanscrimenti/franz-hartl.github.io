    <h1>Replications in Experimental Philosophy</h1>

<div style="font-size:14px">
Replications are listed in order by the first author of the paper being replicated. Unless otherwise noted, ratings are based on a scale from 1 to 7. In some cases the data presented below does not appear in that exact form in the original paper.
<br><br>
Much of the research in experimental philosophy -- as in every science -- has built on previous work by replicating and extending earlier results. 
However, these replications have often been buried inside footnotes or more complicated experiments. This website aims to collect and organize these results, and to serve as a resource to researchers in the field.
<br><br>
The more information this website contains, the more useful it will be, so please send in any data you are willing to share. 
Some of the studies below are labelled 'Non-Replication' or 'Non-Replication with modified material.' 
The point of these labels is not to pass judgment on whether the effect is real -- obviously, even real effects sometimes fail to replicate.
Rather, we hope that these labels will make it easier to use this site to see the state of the research in various areas.
<br><br>
Please write to <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/xphipage/Contact.html">Christian Mott</a> if you know of a replication that should be included on this page, if you would like to suggest corrections to the information already available here, or if you have suggestions about how to improve the site. Unpublished data are welcome.
