approach to studying behavior explanations involves
treating them as either "person causes" or "situation causes" and
assessing them via rating scales. An analysis of people's
free-response behavior explanations reveals, however, that the
conceptual distinctions people use in their explanations are more
complex and sophisticated than the person-situation dichotomy
suggests. The authors therefore introduce a model of the conceptual
structure of folk behavior explanations (the network of concepts and
assumptions on which explanations are based) and test it in four
studies. The modes and features of behavior explanations within this
conceptual structure also have specific social functions. Two
additional studies demonstrate that people alter distinct features of
their explanations when pursuing particular impression management
goals, and listeners make inferences about explainers' attitudes based
on these features.
