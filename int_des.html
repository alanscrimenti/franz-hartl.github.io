Three chapters in the first section of this volume explore what unique
conditions underlie
people's ascriptions of intention and how these conditions distinguish
the folk concepts of intention and desire. Bertram Malle and Joshua
Knobe contend that the two concepts are distinguished
by three features: First, intentions are directed at the intender's own
action,
whereas desires can be directed at anything. Second, intentions are
based on some amount of reasoning whereas desires are typically the
input to such reasoning. Third, intentions come with a characteristic
commitment to perform the intended action, whereas desires do not.
Malle and Knobe provide conceptual arguments and empirical data to
support the validity of this tripartite model. They also speculate
about the psychological functions of the folk distinction between
desire and intention.
