</i><b>Note: </b>
This paper was actually written quite a while before it was submitted for publication, and many of the key ideas 
ended up appearing in other publications in the interim.  Still, I thought that it might be helpful to put this paper 
up on the web because it remains the only published source for the experiment (reported in section II) about the conditions
under which people regard omissions as causes.
