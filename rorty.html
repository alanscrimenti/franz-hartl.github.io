<p><b>Early Life</b><br>
<br>
<i>Interviewer:</i> Let's begin with your childhood. Were you a
Trotskyite yourself, or was it just something your parents imposed on
you?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>I was just brought up a Trotskyite, the way people are
brought up Methodists or Jews or something like that. It was just the
faith of the household.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Was it the same with Dewey?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Not really. I mean, Dewey didn't loom as large. My
parents weren't particularly interested in philosophy, and I don't
think they'd read much Dewey.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>And Sidney Hook?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> My father and Sidney Hook had left the Communist Party at
the same time. And that served as a bond between them. He was a family
friend whom I went to see when I decided to go into philosophy. I saw
Sidney when I was seventeen or eighteen. He told me: "So, you want to
be a philosopher. Publish early and often." You know, a few tips of
that general sort and then I saw him over the years and he knew that I
disagreed with him about the Vietnam War. That caused a certain
edginess. But toward the end of his life, the edginess had disappeared,
and we were on reasonably good terms.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Were you isolated by your political beliefs?<br>
<i><br>
Rorty:</i> No, because there was a large enough community, the
so-called Partisan Review crowd, that shared all the views of my
parents. The only isolation was that their anti-communism was unpopular
in the period, roughly '45 to '6~well, '45 to '56-before the invasion
of Hungary. I was always viewed as slightly fanatic in my
anti-communism in that period, which was thanks to my upbringing.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>Why did you leave so early for college ?<br>
<i><br>
Rorty:</i> I didn't like my High School, and it was a way of gefflng
away from it. Chicago in those days would accept you before you'd
finished High School.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> What did you dislike about your High School?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>It just wasn't a very good school, and I didn't have any
friends, and I wasn't learning very much--the usual stumbles.<br>
<i><br>
Int:</i> What led you to major in philosophy?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>Lack of any better ideas. I might equally well have gone
into English or History, but I had been more fascinated by my
philosophy course than by anything else. It was like choosing a major
without anything much in mind. Occasionally, I've regretted not being a
historian, but by now, I think it doesn't really make much difference,
because after you get tenure, you can do what you want anyways.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How attracted to Aristotelianism were you as a college
student?<br>
<i><br>
Rorty:</i> I didn't find Aristotle particularly attractive. It was just
that Aristotle was sort of the sacred text that we had to read over and
over again. Both in the college and in the philosophy department, the
influence of Mckeon was sufficiently great to keep Aristotle at the
forefront of everybody's consciousness. It became something one had to
become familiar with.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Were you drawn to Aristotle's foundationalism?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Yeah, a natural taste for philosophical foundations
common to Plato and Aristotle &#8212; I certainly had it then.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>When did this taste begin to dissolve?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>Twenty or thereabouts; I was just leaving Chicago.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you think it is still important to read philosophers
like Aristotle and Plato?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>Important for somebody. I mean, it would be a great pity
if people ever stopped reading them, but I don't think it's necessary
that everybody read them.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>So you don't think that Plato should be required reading?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>No, I think it would probably be a good idea if
everybody had to read Plato in their senior year of High School or
their f~rst year of college; they'd be better informed about where
their ideas were coming from.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Had you become a staunch pragmatist by the time you reached
Yale?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No, I think I was more confused than that. I don't think
I had any very definite outlook.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> And when you were teaching at Wellesley?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I was reading Peirce all the time, so I must have begun
some sort of move toward pragmatism.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>And yet, you've said that Peirce is overrated.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> That was what I eventually concluded &#8212; I went on to James
and Dewey &#8212; but Peirce was a fashionable figure because he was a
logician, so he looked liked the most respectable pragmatist.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Was logic particularly dominant at Wellesley?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>No, it's just that there was a big emphasis on logic in
the philosophical profession as a whole because of Quine's influence.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How did it feel to go from Wellesley (where you could teach
Heidegger) to the heavily analytic world of Princeton?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>I taught Heidegger at Wellesley just out of curiosity.
At Princeton, I was hired specifically to teach Greek philosophy, so I
did that for a while, until I got tenure and until they got somebody
else to teach Greek philosophy. I was teaching mostly analytic
philosophy, because it was stuff I needed to learn. It was what
everyone was taLking about, and!<br>
I didn't have time for Heidegger until I'd gone through quite a lot of
analytic stuff.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>Why Greek philosophy?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>It wasn't a big, tremendous interest. I had learned
Greek at Chicago simply because it was the fashionable thing to do.
Princeton hired me because there weren't many Ph.D.'s who both knew
analytic philosophy and knew Greek. My dissertation was a third on
Aristotle, a third on Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz and a third on
Carnap and Goodman. I think the man who hired me was attracted by the
combination of Aristotie with some reference to the original text with
Carnap.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Were you already somewhat disaffected with analytic
philosophy?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>No. On the contrary, I assumed that it was the wave of
the future and that my job was to find out all about it so that I could
get in on it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>When did your views begin to change?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>Maybe half-way through my twenty years at Princeton or
something like that.<br>
<br>
<i>Int: </i>What led to this shift?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Nothing in particular, just I was getting bored with the
stuff I was writing about. I wanted to teach something different. I
don't remember anything more clearly.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Did it have anything to do with your depression?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty: </i>I was clinically depressed, but that was much later.
That was '68 or '69...0h wait, that would be about right. Oh yeah,
maybe you're right. I don't know; I never correlated the two.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Could you comment on the APA nomination scandal?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> There was a revolt by the non-analytic philosophers
against the so-called "analytic establishment," and I was thought to
have used my powers as President presiding over the meeting unfairly on
the side of the anti-analytic people.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Did you actually do anything unfair?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I don't think so. Again, it's a little hard to remember,
but I remember an extremely turbulent meeting that I was trying
desperately to maintain control over from the chair. I guess the
crucial issue was would I throw out the vote and call for a new vote,
or something like that...or, no, would I suspend the vote. It was one
of those complicated parliamentary things where it was in the
President's discretion to say we have to go over the credentials of the
voters again, or something like that. And I refused to give the ruling
that would have favored the analysts. But it seemed the right thing to
do at the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature<br>
</b><br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you have any idea why <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature</i> was so widely read?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I still don't understand it. One of the referees for
Princeton Press answered the standard question on the form they send
him, 'will this be of interest outside its own field?" by saying,
"Absolutely not. It's strictly a book for philosophy professors." That
seemed right to me, so I never did understand it. I think many more
people read it outside the feld than ever read it inside the field;
maybe because it was sort of a follow-up to Kuhn. Many people outside
of philosophy were impressed by Kuhn, and my book was sort of more
along the Kuhnian line.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Your more recent work is less concerned with the specifics
of analytic philosophy. Does that indicate a change in your views or
just a shift in your interests?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> A little of both, I suppose. Mainly a change of interest.
I don't know; maybe there isn't any change in views. Maybe its just an
interest in seeing philosophy in a longer-term, historical perspective.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> You also seem to have shifted your interests from Quine to
Davidson.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No, I just think Davidson went way beyond Quine. I think
Quine had certain ideas in germ which only came to fruition in Davidson.<br>
<br>
Int: And Dewey seems to have superceded them all.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think it's because Quine and Sellars are philosophy
professors and nothing more, whereas Dewey was a larger figure than
just a philosophy professor, more suitable for hero worship.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> In <i>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</i>, you
attacked Putnam's early philosophy. What do you think of his more
recent work?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think our views are practically indistinguishable, but
he doesn't. He thinks I'm a relativist and he isn't. And I think: if
I'm a relativist, then he's one too.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Why do you think Putnam sees you as a relativist?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Beats me. I wrote an article about it, but that was as
far as I got.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you still believe that epistemology should be replaced
by hermeneutics?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No, I think it was an unfortunate phrase. I wish I'd
never mentioned hermeneutics. The last chapter of <i>Philosophy and
the Mirror of Nature</i> isn't very good. I think I just should have
said: we ought to be able to think of something more interesting to do
than keep the epistemology industry going.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Consequences of Pragmatism<br>
</b><br>
<i>Int:</i> Your next book, <i>Consequences of Pragmatism</i>, was
largely composed of essays on other philosophers. What accounts for the
particular selection?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Just accident. I was asked to give a Dewey lecture; I was
asked to give a lecture on this and that. It's just a collection of
occasional pieces which were written in response to particular demands.
There wasn't any particular coherence to it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> And why did you devote so much space to comments on other
philosophers?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> It's what I know how to do.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> In the introduction to Consequences, you contend that when
the secret police break down the door, there will be nothing to tell
them of the form "There is something within you which you are
betraying." Why do you think that this comment aroused so much
controversy?<br>
</p>
<p><i>Rorty:</i> I don't know. Maybe it was just a particularly vivid
formulation of anti-foundationalism or something like that. I suppose
it had a certain shock value as a way of suggesting that universalistic
Kantian ethics wouldn't work. Moral philosophy in the Anglophone world
is still basically Kantian in inspiration, so if you make anti-Kantian
remarks, it shocks.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you think that your objectors have misinterpreted the
secret police example?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No, I don't think they're misinterpreting it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Is moral philosophy becoming less Kantian?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Not much. I mean, there are people... I guess a few
recent books: Bernard Williams' <i>Shame and Necessity</i>, Annette
Baier's <i>Moral Prejudices</i>...yeah, occasionally. It's hard to
keep moral philosophy as an academic subdiscipline going if you're a
pragmatist. The name of the game in moral philosophy is finding
principles and then finding counter-examples to the other guy's
principles. Pragmatists aren't very big on principles. There isn't much
to do in moral philosophy if you're a pragmatist.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Is that why pragmatism has met with such vehement
opposition?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Not the main reason. It might have had something to do
with it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> I'm curious about your essay "The World Well Lost." You say
there that we can't be sure whether or not there are multiple
conceptual schemes. But later, in your response to Lyotard, you say
explicitly that the very idea of conceptual schemes is an incoherent
one. Does this indicate a change in your views?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Well, that's just something I stole from Davidson. "The
World Well Lost" was sort of a preview of something that Davidson was
later to say in "The Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme." I had picked it
up from talking to Davidson and reading his manuscripts and so on.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you disagree with any of Davidson's views?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I can't think of anything we really disagree about that
doesn't seem to me a verbal issue, but Davidson may have a different
view of the matter. Well, one thing is that he keeps saying truth is an
absolutely central concept, and I can't see what makes it central or
basic. I take Davidson to be saying that truth, belief, meaning,
intention, rationality, cognitivity- all these notions are parts of a
seamless web, and that seems to me a useful point to make, that you
can't have any of these notions without all the others. It's just that
he then wants to say, "And truth is in the middle." I can't see why you
have to have a middle.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Putnam has also criticized you for deemphasizing truth.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Putnam keeps saying that you have to have what he calls
"substantive truth." I take Davidson to be saying: there's not much
pointing in saying truth is substantive. I don't think Davidson has any
better idea than I do what Putnam means by that. Nonetheless, he
somehow attaches a weight to the notion that I can't seem to attach to
it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> You argue in <i>Consequences</i> that Cavell gives undue
credit to early analytic philosophers like Russell and Price. Do you
think that these philosophers should still be taught?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No. Well, people who are interested in them should teach
them, but I don't think that anybody should feel that they're more
important than James Mill or Christian Wolf or other eminent historical
figures. Put it this way: I think you have to!<br>
read Frege and Russell in order to understand the Philosophical
Investigations. And you have to read Russell and Carnap in order to
understand what's important about Quine and Davidson. These are people
who are reacting to a quite determinate set of philosophical positions,
and you don't get the point unless you know what they're reacting to.
Part of the reason you read Leibniz and Hume is to figure out what Kant
was going on about.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Hubert Dreyfus has disagreed with the portrait of Heidegger
that you paint in <i>Consequences of Pragmatism</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Bert and I have argued for years about the relevance of
Husserl and Merleau-Ponty to the early Heidegger. I have no use for
Husserl, and I've never found the importance in Merleau-Ponty that
Charles Taylor and Bert Dreyfus do. I tend to read Being and Tme as if
phenomenology either didn't exist or wasn't important, whereas Bert
thinks it does exist and is important. Bert finds the particular list
of <i>Existentiale</i> in <i>Being and Time</i> fascinating, and I
don't. I don't know why, but they strike me as interesting but
arbitrary and not particularly memorable.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Was Heidegger offerring the <i>Existentiale</i> as a
pragmatist might, or did he view them as the Ultimate Phenomenological
Truth?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think at the time he was advancing them as the Ultimate
Phenomenological Truth, but I think it's nice that he never refers to
them again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Contingency, Irony and Solidarity<br>
</b><br>
<i>Int:</i> In <i>Contingency, Irony and Solidarity</i>, you extoll
the "strong poet." Do you think that a person should be considered
deficient or bad, if he or she were not a strong poet?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Yeah, I think that of the various potentialities that
human beings might hope to fulfill, such a person fulfills only some
and leaves others unfulfilled. I think it comes to saying: Ideally,
people ought to be both imaginative and nice. Some people are nice
without being imaginative. Some people are imaginative without being
nice. One out of two isn't bad, but it would be nice to have both.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Are there any private virtues other than imagination?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No. That's just because I'm extending the term
'imaginative' to mean every project of self-creation, every sense of
duty to oneself.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How do think that the university can encourage imagination?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think that liberal education holds out examples of
people who have done something startling and original and thus inspires
people to think, "Gee, maybe I could do something startling and
original too." But it isn't that one department rather than another is
in charge of this activity. Philosophy departments hold out the
examples of people like Hegel and Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, and art
departments hold out the examples of people like Da Vinci and Cezanne.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you have any suggestions about teaching style?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Teaching is largely a matter of some kind of rapport
established between the teacher and the student. This is purely
accidental and unpredictable and unplannable. You can have an utterly
dry teaching style and yet something in what you're saying and the way
you're saying it will turn certain students on. I think the nice thing
about our education system is that you get to see a lot of different
teachers doing their thing about a lot of different figures. Sooner or
later, something might grab you.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Many philosophers have argued that, as a matter of
empirical psychology, it is impossible to die for a belief that you
hold pragmatically.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I hope they're wrong, but I can't prove it.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> In <i>Contingency</i>, you maintain that your political
views are not in any way implied by your philosophy of language. What
about your theory of the self could one accept Davidson's philosophy of
language and still believe in a core of the self?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think it might be hard. For all I know, it can be done,
but I've never tried the experiment. I think that Davidson's approach
to intentionality, meaning, belief, truth and so on goes together with
Dennett's stuff about the intentional stance, and I think, once you see
the intentional stance, the attribution of beliefs and desires to
organisms or machines as a way of handling the organisms and machines
and knowing what they'll do next, it's very difficult to think of the
self in the way in which what Dennett calls "the picture of the
Cartesian theater" requires you to think of the self. I think Dennett
has a brilliant chapter in <i>Consciousness Explained</i> &#8212; Chapter 13
on "The Self as Center of Narrative Gravity" &#8212; and I think that view of
the self is nicely integrated with the rest of Dennett's system and
thus <i>a fortiori </i>with Davidson's system.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> And once we drop the notion of a core-self, must we abandon
the ethic of purification as well?<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Yeah... No, I shouldn't say that. I guess that all that has
to go is a metaphysical backup for an ethic of purification.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Could one hold onto a core of the self in the same way?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No. You couldn't bave a notion of a core of the self, but
you could have a notion of a purer self. You can say with Dennett that
a decision about what kind of person to be is a decision about what
kind of narrative to make yourself the center of gravity of. One of the
narratives that you might have in mind would be the narrative of a
process of purification.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Were you ever attracted to an ethic of purification?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Yeah, mainly when I was an adolescent. I was attracted by
Augustine's <i>Confessions</i>, books like Bonaventure's <i>Itinerary
of the Mind to God</i>, Spinoza's <i>Tractatus on the Emendation of
the Intellect</i>, various variations on the theme of ascent up the
divided line-stories of purification of that sort. I tried to attach
them to a religious view, but it didn't seem to work, so I dropped the
religious bit and just stuck to the philosophical point.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Were your religious beliefs influenced by your grandfather
Walter Rauschenbush?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Only in that his socialism was continued by my parents.
It was sort of like he was the socialist of the previous generation.
Much later, I got around to reading his books and liked them, but I
don't know that that was much of an influence.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Why did you turn away from religion? Was it because of the
emphasis on humility?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Yeah, partially that and partly I just couldn't believe
that God had actually been incarnated in one person.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Concluding Remarks<br>
</b><br>
<i>Int:</i> How do you respond to the recent conservative attacks on
the academy?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think that the academic left has made sort of an ass of
itself and has given easy targets for the conservatives, but basically
I think that the conservatives are just either jealous of the soft life
that we professors have or else working for the Republicans and trying
to underm~ne the universities the same way they undermined the trade
unions. I mean that the universities and colleges are bastions of the
left in America, and the closest thing we have to the left is roughly
the left wing of the Democratic Party, and if you look at the
statistics on what kind of professor votes for what, the humanities and
the social science professors always vote overwhelmingly democratic,
and obviously the youth that is exposed to courses in social sciences
and humanities is going to be gently nudged in a leftward direction.
The Republicans are quite aware of this fact, and they would like to
stop it from happening. Any club that will beat the universities is
going to look good to them. The more the English depanments make fools
of themselves by being politically correct, the easier a target the
Republicans are going to have.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Is that what you meant by "making asses of themselves"?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think that the English departments have made it
possible to have a career teaching English without caring much about
literature or knowing much about literature but just producing rather
trite, formulaic, politicized readings of this or that text. This makes
it an easy target. There's a kind of formulaic leftist rhetoric that's
been developed in the wake of Foucault, which permits you to exercise a
kind of hermeneutics of suspicion on anything from the phonebook to
Proust. It's sort of an obviously easy way to write books, articles,
and it produces work of very low intellectual quality. And so, this
makes this kind of thing an easy target from the outside. It permits
people like Roger Kimball and D'Souza to say these people aren't really
scholars, which is true. I think that the use made of Foucault and
Derrida in American departments of literature had been, on the whole,
unfortunate, but it's not their fault. Nobody's responsible for their
followers.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> You have criticized Foucault and others for their radical
politics.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> What I object to about them is that they never talk in
terms of possible legislation, possible national economic policy,
things that might actually be debated between political candidates and
you might pass a law about or something like that. It seems to me to be
a continuation of the '60s attitude that the system is so hopelessly
corrupt that you don't really take part in the day-to-day politics. You
rise above it and sneer at it. They don't even try to be solutions.
They're radical critiques without radical proposals.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Should philosophers offer specific political proposals?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I don't think there's any general rule. I mean, some
people are good at this; some people aren't. Everybody's supposed to
try to be a good citizen, but not philosophy professors any more than
nurses or plumbers.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How do you account for your own fame?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I'm not sure. I was genuinely puzzled why<i> Philosophy
and the Mirror of Nature</i> sold as much as it did. Obviously, I gave
people something it turned out they wanted, but I'm not quite sure what
it was that they wanted. And I've been truly puzzled about all the
translations. My stuff gets translated quite widely. When you find out
that <i>Contingency, Irony and Solidarity</i> is being translated into
Bulgarian &#8212; what do I know about Bulgaria? What do I know about why
anybody there finds it interesting? It's a mystery to me.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How would you have liked your books to be received? How,
for example, might future philosophers continue your project?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I don't see it as a unified project. I've written books
over the years, expressing changes in views of this and that, and it's
always nice if somebody finds them interesting, but it doesn't seem to
me to represent a trend or to elaborate a<br>
project.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Int:</i> Do you think that pragmatism itself might become a trend?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> In some very large sense of pragmatism, yes. I think that
culture might continue to get less and less metaphysical, and I think
the influence of Kant on standard political and moral rhetoric might
gradually decrease. Int: And could professional philosophers become
pragmatists?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No. I think that analytic philosophy departments
professionalize themselves precisely by cutting the links between
philosophy and history and literature and trying to establish links
with psychology, physics, stuff like that, harder disciplines. And I
think that the analytic philosophers were correct in thinking that they
would only have a really autonomous profession if they drifted away or
cut themselves off from history and literature. I think that, just in
so far as you professionalize, you have to disagree with Dewey that the
problems of philosophy are historically produced, culturally produced,
sort of epiphenomena of wider cultural changes. You have to think of
philosophy as having a more autonomous problematic than Dewey thought
it did. If all the philosophy professors became pragmatists, it's not
clear what a philosophy department would look like. The impulse to say
we've got a separate discipline which is neither history, nor
literature would be much weaker.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Are you saying that philosophy departments should disappear?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I think that what's important is that people study the
great dead philosophers, and they are sufficiently difficult that even
if you folded us into literature departments, you'd still have to have
a subdiscipline within literature departments consisting of a certain
literary tradition that included Phto and Aristotle and St. Thomas and
Leibniz and Kant and a lot of neat stuff like that, so you might as
well just have a separate department.<br>

<i>Int:</i> So the importance of philosophy depanments is that they
teach the great dead philosophers?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Not their only importance, but if you ask why there's got
to be a relatively autonomous discipline or subdiscipline, I think the
ultimate answer is: because somebody's got to read these difficult
books, and it takes a lot of time.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Why do you think you have become so notorious?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I don't know. Of course, my notoriety is nothing compared
to Derrida, who's <i>really</i> notorious, but Derrida himself is
puzzled about why he gets everybody's hackles up, why there's this
tremendous fuss about him and why he's seen as a terrible danger to
civilization or the university. I'm puzzled too. I don't know why
Derrida becomes demonized in this way, and I don't why I become
demonized to this much lesser extent.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> How did you first become interested in Derrida?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> There happened to be a reading group at Princeton led by
a colleague in English named Jonathan Arac, and he and his friends
would sit around reading Derrida (who hadn't been translated). So I
just joined the group and began reading.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Derrida seems to play an increasingly important role in
your work.<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Yeah, I guess. I guess what happened was that I began
writing for this audience of literary theorists, that grew up in the
'70s in literature departments, because they were the people who read
the books that I wanted to talk about. That meant I drifted away from
the things that my fellow philosophy professors were reading and began
dropping different names. I think that I offered the same alternative
Stanley Fish did, and I think that Fish and I are basically saying the
same thing: you can have the benefits of so-called European post-modern
thought without the nonsense. You can have the benefits in plainer
language. You can have what's good about them without the jargon and
the complexity.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Why do you think that the European post-modernists use
jargon?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Because they're great and original minds. Great and
original minds typically develop their own jargons.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> And yourself &#8212; how have you contributed to the ideas that
had already been developed by Dewey, Wittgenstein and Heidegger?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> Not at all. I don't think I have any original ideas. I
think that all I do is pick up bits of Derrida and bits of Dewey and
put them next to each other and bits of Davidson and bits of
Wittgenstein and stuff like that. It's just a talent for bricolage,
rather than any originality. If you don't have an original mind, you
comment on people who do.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Finally, do think you could tell us your plans for the
future?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> I teach next year, then I'm on sabbatical in '96-'97.
then I figure on teaching two years, then retiring if I can afford it.
I figure I'll have enough savings to retire in 1999.<br>
<br>
<i>Int:</i> Do you have any plans as to what you'll do philosophically
in the years ahead?<br>
<br>
<i>Rorty:</i> No.<br>
