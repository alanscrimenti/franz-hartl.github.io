<p><b>Note:</b> This paper reports two new results: (1) an effect of moral considerations on intuitions about the proper use of phrases like 'in order to' and (2) a difference between people's intuitions about the use of 'intentionally' and their intuitions about the use of 'intention.' </p>
<p>As it happens, the paper was originally published as a response to a paper by Adams and Steadman, which was in turn a response
to an earlier paper of mine. However, the paper should be accessible even to people who have no interest in this whole chain of responses and counter-responses.</p>
