		<p><font size="4"><b>Summary: </b>The paper is an experimental investigation of the role that moral considerations play in people's concept of intentional action.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">For example, in one experiment, subjects were randomly assigned either to a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition.' Subjects in the harm condition were given the following vignette:</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">
		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="15%"></td>
				<td width="70%">The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, &#145;We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.&#146;<br>
					<br>
					The chairman of the board answered, &#145;I don&#146;t care at all about harming the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let&#146;s start the new program.&#146;<br>
					<br>
					They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was harmed.<br>
				</td>
				<td width="15%"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><br>
		They were then asked whether or not the chairman the chairman harmed the environment <i>intentionally</i>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><br>
		Subjects in the help condition received a vignette that was almost exactly the same, except that the word 'harm' was replaced with 'help.'</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">
		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
			<tr>
				<td width="15%"></td>
				<td width="70%">The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, &#145;We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, and it will also help the environment.&#146;<br>
					<br>
					The chairman of the board answered, &#145;I don&#146;t care at all about helping the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let&#146;s start the new program.&#146;<br>
					<br>
					They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was helped.<br>
				</td>
				<td width="15%"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</font></p>
		<font size="4">
		</font></p>
		<font size="4">They were then asked whether or not the chairman helped the environment <i>intentionally</i>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><i>
		</i></font></p>
		<p><font size="4">These two conditions produced two radically different patterns of results &#151; with most  subjects (82%) in the harm condition saying that the agent acted intentionally, but relatively few subjects (23%) in the help condition saying that the agent acted intentionally.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4">The paper argues that this effect is best explained in terms of the role that moral considerations play in people's concept of intentional action.<br>
